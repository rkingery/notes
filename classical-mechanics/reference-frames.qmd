# Reference Frames

The laws of mechanics as formulated thus far are not valid as written for every observer. They are valid only for a special class of observers in *inertial* reference frames. A classical **inertial reference frame** is a reference frame or coordinate system in which Newton's Laws hold with no modifications. That such frames even exist is an experimental fact of nature.

In practice, however, many reference frames of interest are *non-inertial*, which means Newton's Laws does not hold in those reference frames. We have to modify Newton's Laws in these frames by adding so-called **fictitious forces**. We'll begin by focusing on the most common non-inertial frames, the *rotating reference frames*.
