# Maxwell's Equations

Thus far we've spent a considerable amount of time studying *statics*, focusing on fields that are time-independent. We will now turn our attention to *dynamics*, where we allow the fields to depend explicitly on time. This leads us into the subject of *electrodynamics*, which we will study in depth for the rest of the course. In electrodynamics, we'll see that the electric and magnetic fields become coupled through Maxwell's equations, with changing electric fields giving rise to magnetic fields and vice versa. Before deriving Maxwell's equations and studying their implications, we'll first introduce need to introduce the important concept of electromagnetic force, from which we'll introduce both Ohm's law and Faraday's law for the first time.

## Electromotive Force

When a conductor is placed in the presence of an external electric field, the E-field causes the charges inside the conductor to move until the E-field inside the conductor vanishes. This results in a temporary current in the conductor that quickly subsides as the charges reach electrostatic equilibrium.

Something different happens, however, when we take a conducting material and hook it up to a power source. If the power source creates a constant electric field across the conductor, we find that a steady current is created as long as the power source is turned on. We'd now like to understand why exactly this happens. After all, some force must be causing the charges to keep moving, otherwise they'd come to rest. This will lead us to the idea of electromotive force. 

Before discussing this idea though we'll first introduce Ohm's law, an important phenomenological relationship between the current flowing through a material and an applied external E-field.

### Ohm's Law

When a material is brought into contact with an external electric field, the E-field will cause charges inside the conductor to move in the direction of the field, creating an induced current inside the material. For many materials, this induced current is linearly proportional to the external E-field. This phenomenological relationship is known as *Ohm's Law*, which says
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E}
} \ .
$$
The constant $\sigma$ is an empirical constant that depends on the material, called the electrical *conductivity* of the material. As the name suggests, it's a measure of how much a given material is able to conduct current in response to an external field. It's precisely materials with a very high conductivity that we call conductors, since in a good conductor we expect that the smallest applied E-field would create the highest induced current. Materials with low conductivity are similarly called insulators, since in a good insulator we expect that a large applied E-field is needed to produce even the slightest amount of induced current. A perfect conductor would have an infinite, meaning *any* non-zero E-field would produce an infinitely high induced current, while a perfect insulator would have a zero conductivity, meaning no amount of E-field would produce an induced current.

More commonly in applied settings, one defines $\rho \equiv 1/\sigma$, which is called the electrical *resistivity* of the material. In this case Ohm's law takes the form $\rho \mathbf{J} = \mathbf{E}$. Be careful not to confuse $\rho$ in this case with the charge density, as unfortunately the same notation is commonly used for both. Materials with low resistivity make good conductors, while those with high resistivity make good insulators. A perfect conductor would have a zero resistivity, while a perfect insulator has an infinite resistivity.

In Gaussian units, dimensional analysis requires that conductivity have dimensions of inverse time. This means that resistivity must have dimensions of time, or units of seconds in Gaussian units. In SI units, resistivity is typically given in units of Ohm-meters, or $\Omega \cdot \text{m}$, with $1 \ \Omega \cdot \text{m} \approx 10^{-10} \ \text{s}$. The Ohm is a measure of a related unit called electrical *resistance*, which we'll see soon.

Most tables of materials list a material's resistivity rather than its conductivity, which is just the reciprocal of resistivity. Real life materials of course are neither perfect insulators nor perfect conductors, but many materials can be approximated as such. For example, good conductors like copper, gold, silver, and aluminum have resistivities of $\rho \sim 10^{-8} \ \Omega \cdot \text{m}$ or $\rho \sim 10^{-18} \ \text{s}$. Meanwhile, good insulators like quartz, glass, or wood have resistivities in the range $\rho \sim 10^{8} - 10^{16} \ \Omega \cdot \text{m}$ or $\rho \sim 10^{-2} - 10^{6} \ \text{s}$.

At this point it's fair to ask how exactly Ohm's law arises. After all, it's a phenomenological law, not a fundamental law. This means that Ohm's law should be *derivable* from more fundamental physics. Unfortunately, a rigorous derivation of Ohm's law would require quantum mechanics, which we won't go into. However, we can give a reasonable enough derivation of Ohm's law from classical physics alone using a crude approximation of the quantum behavior of a material known as the *Drude model*.

The idea of the Drude model is to suppose that a solid material is composed of a fixed set of atoms along with a classical free gas of electrons, which are allowed to collide with the fixed atoms at some frequency. As long as no external force is applied on the electrons, they'll move in a random walk through the material, leading to diffusion. But, if an external force is applied, these electrons will tend on average to move in the direction of the force, creating a random walk with drift.

More formally, suppose the electron gas has a number density of $n$ particles per unit volume. Each electron has the same mass $m_e$ and the same charge $-e$. Suppose that when an external E-field $\mathbf{E}$ is applied across the material, these electrons move opposite the E-field with an average velocity $-\mathbf{v}$. We'll also suppose these electrons are allowed to collide with the fixed atoms inside the material with some average collision frequency $\nu_e$.

In the Drude model, we assume each electron is acted on by two forces, an applied electric force $-e\mathbf{E}$, and a linear drag force opposing motion due to the collisions, given by $m_e \nu_e \mathbf{v}$. By Newton's second law, we then have
$$
-m_e \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -e \mathbf{E} + m_e \nu_e \mathbf{v} \ .
$$
If we multiply both sides by $-en/m_e$ and simplify, this becomes
$$
\frac{d}{dt} en\mathbf{v} = \frac{e^2n}{m_e} \mathbf{E} - \nu_e en\mathbf{v} \ .
$$
Now, the charge density of the electrons is just their charge times the number density, or $\rho = -en$. This means their current density is $\mathbf{J} = -\rho \mathbf{v} = en\mathbf{v}$. Remember, the current always flows in the opposite direction in which electrons flow. We thus now have a differential equation for the current density in terms of the electric field,
$$
\frac{d\mathbf{J}}{dt} = \frac{e^2 n}{m_e} \mathbf{E} - \nu_e \mathbf{J} \ .
$$
This differential equation is known as the *generalized Ohm's law*. It captures both the transient and steady state behavior of the moving electrons. Now, we're rarely interested in the transient behavior. We only want the steady state behavior, which is what gives rise to the steady current. At steady state we have $d\mathbf{J}/dt = 0$, which means
$$
\mathbf{J} = \frac{e^2 n}{m_e \nu_e} \mathbf{E} \ .
$$
We've thus managed to derive Ohm's law from the simple Drude model. Evidently, the conductivity $\sigma$ is given by
$$
\sigma \equiv \frac{e^2 n}{m_e \nu_e} \ .
$$
Since both the number density $n$ and the collision frequency $\nu_e$ are material dependent, $\sigma$ will be material dependent as well.



where we've defined $\omega_p^2 \equiv 4\pi e^2 n/m_e$, where $\omega_p$ is some constant with units of angular frequency, known as the *plasma frequency*. The plasma frequency in a sense captures the frequency with which the electrons in the gas are oscillating.

These particles are allowed to collide with each other with some frequency, but otherwise act as a free gas.

### Electromotive Force


### Faraday's Law

In the early 19th century, Faraday studied the behavior of current flowing through an electric circuit. In doing so he accidentally stumbled on one of the most important facts of electromagnetism, that electric and magnetic fields are related. Specifically, Faraday observed that he could measure a brief transient current flowing through a circuit under the following conditions:

- If the steady current in a second nearby circuit is turned on or off.
- If the second circuit is moved relative to the first circuit while a steady current is flowing through it.
- If a bar magnet is thrust into or out of the first circuit.

- If none of these things is taking place, no current is measured to flow through the first circuit.

Faraday interpreted the transient current flow as being due to a changing magnetic flux through the first circuit, with the changing magnetic flux inducing an electric field around the circuit via an *electromotive force*. He called this phenomenon *electromagnetic induction*.

### Faraday's Law

Nowadays we interpret Faraday's results mathematically as follows. Suppose a closed circuit is running along some closed loop $\mathcal{C}$ containing a bounded open surface $\mathcal{S}$ with unit normal $\mathbf{n}$. In the background we suppose there is some magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$. Then there will be a magnetic flux $\Phi_B$ through the circuit given by the integral
$$
\Phi_B = \int_\mathcal{S} da \ \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{n} \ .
$$
Suppose an electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is present at each point along the circuit. Then we define the *electromotive force* or *EMF* $\mathcal{E}$ around the circuit as the closed loop integral
$$
\mathcal{E} \equiv \oint_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \ .
$$
Notice that despite its name, EMF is not a force. It doesn't even have dimensions of force, but instead dimensions of scalar potential or voltage. The EMF should be thought of as a *source voltage* created across the circuit due to some power source. For instance, if a circuit is hooked up to a battery, the EMF is the source voltage created by the battery itself. If the power source is some changing magnetic field as Faraday suggests, it's the changing magnetic field that creates the EMF.

Faraday's observations can now be expressed mathematically by saying the induced EMF around a circuit is proportional to the time derivative of the magnetic flux through the circuit,
$$
\mathcal{E} = -k \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \ .
$$
The proportionality constant $k$ depends only on the choice of units. It is not an empirical constant. From dimensional analysis, it's clear that if we want $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to have the same units then $k$ must have units of inverse velocity. Since the speed of light $c$ is the only characteristic velocity available to us, we choose $k \equiv 1/c$, so that in Gaussian units we have
$$
\boxed{
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{1}{c} \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
} \ .
$$
This relation between EMF and magnetic flux is known as *Faraday's Law*.
