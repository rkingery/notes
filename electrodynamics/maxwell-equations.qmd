# Electromagnetic Induction

Thus far we've spent a considerable amount of time studying *statics*, focusing on fields that are time-independent. We will now begin turning our attention to *dynamics*, where we allow the fields to depend explicitly on time. This leads us into the subject of *electrodynamics*, which we will study in depth for the rest of the course. To begin our study of this topic we will discuss a few important concepts that will lead us in the next chapter to Maxwell's equations, the crown jewel of electromagnetism. In this chapter, we'll start moving in this direction by discussing things like Ohm's law, electromotive force, Faraday's law, and electromagnetic induction.

## Ohm's Law

When a material is brought into contact with external electromagnetic fields, these fields will cause any unbound electrons inside the material to move in response to the fields, creating an induced current inside the material. If a material is placed in the vicinity of an external E-field $\mathbf{E}$ and an external B-field $\mathbf{B}$, there will be an induced current density $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B})$ that's some function of these fields. Assuming the material is in electrostatic equilibrium before these fields are turned on, we can Taylor expand $\mathbf{J}$ to get a power series in $\mathbf{E}$. The $j$<sup>th</sup> component of the current density can then be written
$$
J_i = \sigma_{ij}(\mathbf{B}) E_i + \sigma_{ijk}(\mathbf{B}) E_j E_k + \cdots \ ,
$$
where the coefficients are some function of $\mathbf{B}$. If the applied E-field is sufficiently weak we can truncate to leading order to get
$$
J_i \approx \sigma_{ij}(\mathbf{B}) E_i \ .
$$
The coefficients $\sigma_{ij}(\mathbf{B})$ together form a $3 \times 3$ matrix, called the *conductivity matrix*. In general this matrix can be arbitrarily complicated. In the special case that the material is macroscopically *isotropic*, or uniform, and if $\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{0}$, this matrix becomes diagonal with $\sigma_{ij} = \sigma \delta_{ij}$, where $\sigma$ is some scalar constant. When this is true we get one version of *Ohm's Law*,
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E}
} \ .
$$
The scalar $\sigma$ is an empirical constant that depends on the material. It's known as the electrical *conductivity*. As the name suggests, it's a measure of how much a given material is able to conduct current in response to an external E-field. It's precisely materials with a very high conductivity that we call conductors, since in a good conductor we expect that the smallest applied E-field would create the highest induced current. Materials with low conductivity are similarly called insulators, since in a good insulator we expect that a large applied E-field is needed to produce even the slightest amount of induced current. A perfect conductor would have an infinite, meaning *any* non-zero E-field would produce an infinitely high induced current, while a perfect insulator would have a zero conductivity, meaning no amount of E-field would produce an induced current.

In applied settings, one commonly defines $\rho \equiv 1/\sigma$, which is called the electrical *resistivity* of the material. In this case Ohm's law takes the form $\rho \mathbf{J} = \mathbf{E}$. Be careful not to confuse $\rho$ in this case with the charge density, as unfortunately the same notation is commonly used for both. Materials with low resistivity make good conductors, while those with high resistivity make good insulators. A perfect conductor would have a zero resistivity, while a perfect insulator has an infinite resistivity.

In Gaussian units, dimensional analysis requires that conductivity have dimensions of inverse time. This means that resistivity must have dimensions of time, or units of seconds in Gaussian units. In SI units, resistivity is typically given in units of Ohm-meters, or $\Omega \cdot \text{m}$, with $1 \ \Omega \cdot \text{m} \approx 10^{-10} \ \text{s}$. One Ohm is defined to be one volt per amp, and is a measure of electrical *resistance*, a related quantity we'll come back to below.

Most tables of materials list a material's resistivity rather than its conductivity, which is just the reciprocal of resistivity. Real life materials of course are neither perfect insulators nor perfect conductors, but many materials can be approximated as such. For example, good conductors like copper, gold, silver, and aluminum have resistivities of $\rho \sim 10^{-8} \ \Omega \cdot \text{m}$ or $\rho \sim 10^{-18} \ \text{s}$. Meanwhile, good insulators like quartz, glass, or wood have resistivities in the range $\rho \sim 10^{8} - 10^{16} \ \Omega \cdot \text{m}$ or $\rho \sim 10^{-2} - 10^{6} \ \text{s}$.

Notice from Ohm's law that as long as we have a steady current there can be no charge buildup anywhere inside the material. Indeed, since $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0$ for steady currents and $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 4\pi\rho$, by Ohm's law we must have
$$
\rho = \frac{1}{4\pi} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0 \ .
$$
This means inside an Ohmic material with steady current we can assume $\rho = 0$ inside the material. This then means that the inside of the material satisfies Laplace's equation $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$, which means all the tools we derived before can be used to find the potential and E-field inside the material. On the surface, however, things are much more complicated since any excess free charge must accumulate on the surface of the material.

### V = IR

- Redo this section. Focus on isotropic materials hooked up to electrodes held at constant voltages.

Of course, the version of Ohm's law given above isn't the one most of us are probably familiar with. We're used to seeing Ohm's law in terms of voltage and current, not E-field and current density. To see how we get the more familiar version of Ohm's law, suppose â€¦



the material in question is a wire with cross-sectional area $A$ and length $L$. If the applied E-field is approximately constant and directed along the wire, the potential difference $V$ across the wire is approximately
$$
V = \int_0^d \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \approx |\mathbf{E}| L \ .
$$
Moreover, assuming the induced current $I$ running through the wire is approximately uniform, we have
$$
I = \int \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{a} \approx |\mathbf{J}| A \ .
$$
Plugging these expressions into Ohm's law above and multiplying both sides by $L/\sigma$, we have
$$
V = \frac{L}{\sigma A} I \ .
$$
The proportionality constant $R \equiv \sigma A/L$ we recognize as the electrical *resistance*. We thus have the familiar form of Ohm's law,
$$
\boxed{
V = IR
} \ .
$$
Evidently, the resistance is a function of *both* the conductivity properties of the material as well as its geometry. The greater the conductivity of the wire or the greater its cross-sectional area, the lower its resistance. The longer the wire is, the higher its resistance. For this reason, it doesn't make sense to take about the resistance of a material. It only makes sense to take about the resistance of a given *piece* of material, for example a piece of wire.

In Gaussian units, resistance has dimensions of time over distance, or units of $\text{s}/\text{cm}$. In SI units, resistance has units of volts per amp, which is commonly called an *Ohm*, denoted $\Omega$, with $1 \ \Omega \approx 10^{-12} \ \text{s}/\text{cm}$. As an example, a copper wire with a length of $1 \ \text{m}$ and a cross-sectional area of $1 \ \text{mm}$ would have a resistance of $R \approx 10^{-2} \ \Omega$ or $R \approx 10^{-14} \ \text{s}/\text{cm}$. A glass tube with the same length and cross-sectional area would have a much higher resistance of $R \approx 10^{14} \ \Omega$ or $R \approx 100 \ \text{s}/\text{cm}$.

### Drude Model

Ohm's law is a phenomenological law, meaning it's a relation that happens to sometimes hold for some materials. It's not a fundamental law of physics. It's thus fair to ask whether we can derive Ohm's law from more fundamental physics. To do this properly we will need to cover a little bit of solid state physics first. 

Strictly speaking, one should use quantum mechanics to truly understand the properties of solids, but it turns out we can get away with deriving Ohm's law from a purely classical theory of solids. This is known as the *Drude model* of a solid. The idea is to model a solid as an imperfect lattice of stationary atoms, or *defects*, along with a classical gas of free electrons that are allowed to flow freely throughout the solid. The free electrons are allowed to scatter with the defects and respond to an external field.

More formally, we make the following assumptions in Drude model:

1. The free electrons are allowed to scatter with defects according to a Poisson process. Suppose $\tau$ is the average time between collisions. It's an empirically measured constant that depends on the solid, known as the *mean free time*. We require that in any infinitesimal time interval $dt$, the probability of an electron scattering with a defect be a uniform value $dt/\tau$.
2. Once an electron scatters with a defect, we assume it immediately comes to rest with velocity $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$.
3. In between scattering events, the free electrons can only interact *classically* with an external applied force field $\mathbf{F}$. 
4. The electrons do not interact with each other at all.

Suppose an electron is moving through the solid with velocity $\mathbf{v}(t)$. We'd like to know what its velocity will be at a time $t+dt$. Since the scattering process is random, this will depend on whether the electron scatters or not. By assumption (2), if the electron *scatters* in the time interval $[t,t+dt]$, it will come to rest with a velocity $\mathbf{v}(t+dt) = \mathbf{0}$. By assumption (3), if the electron *does not* scatter in the time interval $[t,t+dt]$, its motion will be given by Newton's second law, with
$$
m_e \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{v}(t+dt) = \mathbf{F} \ .
$$
If we multiply both sides by $dt/m_e$ and write $d\mathbf{v}(t+dt) = \mathbf{v}(t+dt) - \mathbf{v}(t)$, we then get
$$
\mathbf{v}(t+dt) = \mathbf{v}(t) + \frac{\mathbf{F}}{m_e}dt \ .
$$
Now, the *expected* velocity $\langle\mathbf{v}(t+dt)\rangle$ at time $t+dt$ is just the weighted sum of these two possibilities weighted by the probability that each occurs. By assumption (1), the scattering probability is $dt/\tau$, which means the probability of no scattering is $1-dt/\tau$. We thus have
$$
\langle \mathbf{v}(t+dt) \rangle = \frac{dt}{\tau} \mathbf{0} + \bigg(1 - \frac{dt}{\tau}\bigg) \bigg[\mathbf{v}(t) + \frac{\mathbf{F}}{m_e} dt\bigg] \ .
$$
Now, assuming we know the velocity at time $t$, the expected velocity at time $t$ is just $\langle\mathbf{v}(t)\rangle = \mathbf{v}(t)$. Since $dt$ is infinitesimal, if we move $\mathbf{v}(t)$ to the left-hand side and divide by $dt$, we just get the time derivative of $\langle\mathbf{v}(t)\rangle$,
$$
\frac{d\langle\mathbf{v}(t)\rangle}{dt} \equiv \frac{\langle \mathbf{v}(t+dt) \rangle - \langle \mathbf{v}(t) \rangle}{dt} \ .
$$
To deal with the right-hand side we can expand out and drop any terms of order $dt$. In the end, we have
$$
\frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{m_e} - \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\tau} \ .
$$
Here we've dropped the brackets from the velocity for convenience, since we won't need them anymore. From this point $\mathbf{v}$ will represent the expected, or average, velocity of the free electrons.

In principle the applied force could be any force field. If the field is purely electromagnetic, the force is given by the Lorentz force law, in which case we'd have
$$
\frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} = -\frac{e}{m_e}\bigg[\mathbf{E} + \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B}\bigg] - \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\tau} \ .
$$
Note the minus sign on the charge, since electrons are negatively charged with $q=-e$. We now need to figure out what the current density is. If we suppose there are on average $n$ free electrons per unit volume inside the solid, then the electrons will have a uniform charge density $\rho = -en$, which means there will be a current density
$$
\mathbf{J} = \rho \mathbf{v} = -ne\mathbf{v} \ .
$$
Substituting this into the differential equation, we get
$$
\boxed{
\frac{d \mathbf{J}}{dt} = -\frac{ne^2}{m_e}\mathbf{E} + \frac{e}{m_ec} \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B} - \frac{\mathbf{J}}{\tau} 
} \ .
$$
This differential equation is known as the *generalized Ohm's law*. In principle it describes how the current density responds to the external electromagnetic fields at any point in time. On the right-hand side, we have a driving term plus a relaxation term $-\mathbf{J}/\tau$. The relaxation term forces the current density $\mathbf{J}(t)$ to settle into a steady state on time scales of the relaxation time $\tau$.

In practice we don't really care about the transient behavior of the current, only its steady state behavior. The transient behavior is pretty quick anyway. For most solids $\tau$ is so small that it's barely noticeable. For example, many conducting solids have relaxation times of order $\tau \sim 10^{-14} \ \text{s}$. We'll thus focus on the steady state behavior. At steady state we have $d\mathbf{J}/dt=0$, or
$$
\mathbf{0} = -\frac{ne^2}{m_e}\mathbf{E} + \frac{e}{m_ec} \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B} - \frac{\mathbf{J}}{\tau} \ .
$$
Though perhaps not so obvious, the relationship between the current density and the E-field is now linear. We can see this is the case by solving for $\mathbf{E}$ to get
$$
\mathbf{E} = \frac{m_e}{ne^2 \tau} \mathbf{J} + \frac{1}{nec} \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B} \ .
$$
To simplify the right-hand side, we can define a *resistivity matrix* $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ of the form
$$
\boldsymbol{\rho} \equiv \begin{pmatrix}
m_e / ne^2 \tau & B_z / nec & -B_y / nec \\
-B_z / nec & m_e / ne^2 \tau & B_x / nec \\
B_y / nec & -B_x / nec & m_e / ne^2 \tau
\end{pmatrix} \ .
$$
This matrix will generally be invertible, in which case we can define a conductivity matrix $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ as the matrix inverse of $\boldsymbol{\rho}$. We can then express the components of the current density in terms of the components of the E-field as
$$
J_i = \sigma_{ij} E_j \ .
$$
This is exactly what we wrote down at the beginning of the section. In the special case where $\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{0}$, the conductivity matrix becomes diagonal with $\sigma_{ij} = ne^2\tau/m_e \ \delta_{ij}$. Evidently, the conductivity $\sigma$ is given by
$$
\sigma = \frac{ne^2 \tau}{m_e} \ .
$$
Plugging this in, we finally arrive at Ohm's law, which is what we sought to derive,
$$
\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E} \ .
$$
This derived expression for $\sigma$ hopefully makes sense. After all, the more free electrons there are, the higher $n$ will be, and thus the higher $\sigma$ will be. The longer the time between collisions, the faster the free electrons can move, which means $\sigma$ will be higher.

In this setting, one sometimes defines $\omega_p^2 \equiv 4\pi ne^2/m_e$, where $\omega_p$ is called the *plasma frequency*. The plasma frequency is a measure of the natural frequency of oscillations of electrons inside the electron gas. In terms of the plasma frequency, the conductivity is given by $\sigma = \tau\omega_p^2 / 4\pi$. Thus, the higher the plasma frequency, the higher the conductivity will be.

The fact that we were able to derive Ohm's law from a classical model is interesting. But it is still worth asking how correct the model is. In particular, is the formula it gives for the conductivity correct? It turns out that the formula is correct for many solids, but not all solids. For example, it's highly accurate for <>.

- Finish this part. Research which solids the Drude model works well on, and which it doesn't.

We'll finish this section by noting that we didn't need to include the magnetic field term in the Lorentz force to derive Ohm's law from the Drude model. We could've just set $\mathbf{F} = -e \mathbf{E}$ and the derivation would've been easier. The reason we didn't is to briefly mention an interesting phenomenon in solids known as the *Hall effect*. If $\mathbf{B} \neq \mathbf{0}$, the resistivity matrix won't be diagonal, and the off-diagonal terms will be a function of $\mathbf{B}$. This leads to some interesting behavior. For example, the current will no longer move in the direction of the E-field. For example, if the E-field is oriented in the $x$-direction, there will be a component of current that moves along the $y$-direction, since
$$
E_x = \rho_{xy} J_y = \frac{B_z}{nec} J_y \ .
$$
As we'd expect, the presence of a B-field acts to deflect moving charges away from their trajectories. There are many more interesting things related to the Hall effect. For example, it can be used to levitate a solid. We won't discuss those ideas here.

### Drift Velocity

- The total velocity can be decomposed as $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_\text{th} + \mathbf{v}_d$, where $v_\text{th} \propto \sqrt{k_B T/m_e}$ and $v_d = -e\tau/m \cdot E$
- Show that the thermal velocity averages to zero, leaving only the drift velocity (which is what contributes to the current)

Copper: $v_e = 10^{6} \ m/s$, $\tau = 3 \cdot 10^{-14} \ s$, $n = 10^{29} \ m^{-3}$

Drift velocity: $v_d = a \tau = eE/m_e \tau$, so $E = 1 \ V/m$ over copper wire implies $v_d \approx 0.5 \ cm/s$

### Ohmic Heating

- In detailed balance, the power dissipated is the rate at which work is done on the free charges: $P = dW/dt$
- Rate at which fields do work on free charges per unit volume: $\mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{E}$
- All this work gets dissipated as heat (comes from the drag term)
- What is doing all this work: EMF


$$
w = \int dt \ \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \int dt \ \bigg[\mathbf{E} + \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B}\bigg] \cdot \mathbf{v} = \int dt \ \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{v}
$$

$$
p = \frac{dw}{dt} = \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{v}
$$

$$
P = \sum_i p_i = \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})
$$

$$
J = I/A \ , \ E = V/d \ , P = (I/A) (V/d) \cdot vol = IV = I^2 R
$$





## Electromotive Force

When a conductor is placed in the presence of an external electric field, the E-field causes the charges inside the conductor to move until the E-field inside the conductor vanishes. This results in a temporary current in the conductor that quickly subsides as the charges reach electrostatic equilibrium.

Something different happens, however, when we take a conducting material and hook it up to a power source. If the power source creates a constant electric field across the conductor, we find that a steady current is created as long as the power source is turned on. We'd now like to understand why exactly this happens. After all, some force must be causing the charges to keep moving, otherwise they'd come to rest. This will lead us to the idea of electromotive force.

### Faraday's Law

In the early 19th century, Faraday studied the behavior of current flowing through an electric circuit. In doing so he accidentally stumbled on one of the most important facts of electromagnetism, that electric and magnetic fields are related. Specifically, Faraday observed that he could measure a brief transient current flowing through a circuit under the following conditions:

- If the steady current in a second nearby circuit is turned on or off.
- If the second circuit is moved relative to the first circuit while a steady current is flowing through it.
- If a bar magnet is thrust into or out of the first circuit.

- If none of these things is taking place, no current is measured to flow through the first circuit.

Faraday interpreted the transient current flow as being due to a changing magnetic flux through the first circuit, with the changing magnetic flux inducing an electric field around the circuit via an *electromotive force*. He called this phenomenon *electromagnetic induction*.

---

Nowadays we interpret Faraday's results mathematically as follows. Suppose a closed circuit is running along some closed loop $\mathcal{C}$ containing a bounded open surface $\mathcal{S}$ with unit normal $\mathbf{n}$. In the background we suppose there is some magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$. Then there will be a magnetic flux $\Phi_B$ through the circuit given by the integral
$$
\Phi_B = \int_\mathcal{S} da \ \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{n} \ .
$$
Suppose an electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is present at each point along the circuit. Then we define the *electromotive force* or *EMF* $\mathcal{E}$ around the circuit as the closed loop integral
$$
\mathcal{E} \equiv \oint_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \ .
$$
Notice that despite its name, EMF is not a force. It doesn't even have dimensions of force, but instead dimensions of scalar potential or voltage. The EMF should be thought of as a *source voltage* created across the circuit due to some power source. For instance, if a circuit is hooked up to a battery, the EMF is the source voltage created by the battery itself. If the power source is some changing magnetic field as Faraday suggests, it's the changing magnetic field that creates the EMF.

Faraday's observations can now be expressed mathematically by saying the induced EMF around a circuit is proportional to the time derivative of the magnetic flux through the circuit,
$$
\mathcal{E} = -k \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \ .
$$
The proportionality constant $k$ depends only on the choice of units. It is not an empirical constant. From dimensional analysis, it's clear that if we want $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to have the same units then $k$ must have units of inverse velocity. Since the speed of light $c$ is the only characteristic velocity available to us, we choose $k \equiv 1/c$, so that in Gaussian units we have
$$
\boxed{
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{1}{c} \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
} \ .
$$
This relation between EMF and magnetic flux is known as *Faraday's Law*.

- Consider first doing sections on Ohm's law and EMF first, similar to Griffiths
- Talk about the sign in Faraday's law, and use Lenz' law as a rule to find the directions
