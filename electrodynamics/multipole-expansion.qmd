# Multipole Expansion

In this last chapter on electrostatics, we will conclude our discussion of boundary value problems by discussing briefly the applications of complex methods to solving Laplace's equation in two dimensions. We will then move on to the discussion of the multipole expansion of electrostatics, a way to obtain approximate solutions to electrostatics problems. The idea of a multipole expansion turns out to be very useful not just in electrostatics, but in all of electromagnetism. We'll see extensions of these ideas to other areas of electromagnetism in future chapters.

## Complex Methods

In many cases we find ourselves interested in boundary value problems that can be reduced to two dimensions, that is, problems that can be reduced to two variables. For example, if the symmetry of a problem dictates that the potential cannot depend on the $z$-coordinate, we can write $\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \phi(x,y)$, which reduces the problem to a two dimensional problem in the $xy$-plane.

While the techniques we've covered so far we'll often work in this setting, there's another technique that can be used to solve more difficult problems that employs the tools of complex analysis, particular the theory of analytic functions and conformal mappings. We covered the mathematical background of this subject in the appendix. It's recommend that the reader read that material before proceeding further with this section.

### Complex Potential

Suppose $\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \phi(x,y)$ is the 2-dimensional scalar potential for some boundary value problem free of source charges. Then we know that the potential must satisfy Laplace's equation $\nabla^2 \phi = 0$ inside the boundary region. We know from the appendix that any harmonic function in two dimensions can be thought of as the real part of some analytic function in the complex plane. 

We can thus use the potential $\phi(x,y)$ to define a complex-valued analytic function $F(z)$ of the form
$$
F(z) = \phi(x,y) + i \psi(x,y) \ ,
$$
where $z = x + i y$ is a complex variable whose real part is $x$ and whose imaginary part is $y$, and $\psi(x,y)$ is the *harmonic conjugate* of the potential. We call $F(z)$ the *complex potential*, and $\psi(x,y)$ the *stream function*.

Since $F(z)$ is analytic inside the boundary region, we know that it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations in this region,
$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \quad , \quad
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} \ .
$$
Moreover, the potential $\phi(x,y)$ and the stream function $\psi(x,y)$ must each satisfy Laplace's equation inside the boundary region,
$$
\nabla^2 \phi(x,y) = 0 \quad , \quad \nabla^2 \psi(x,y) = 0 \ .
$$
Since the stream function is the harmonic conjugate of the potential, we can express it formally as a function of the potential by
$$
\psi(x,y) = -\int dx \ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} + \int dy \ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \ .
$$
Indeed, this relationship follows directly from the Cauchy-Riemann equations. This means that the stream function is completely determined by the potential, up to additive constants.

We also know that the level curves of $\phi(x,y)$, i.e. the equipotentials, must be perpendicular to the level curves of $\psi(x,y)$ in this region, or equivalently $\nabla \phi \cdot \nabla \psi = 0$. This lets us assign meaning to the stream function. The level curves of the stream function represent the direction of flow of electric field lines. To see why this is true, observe we can take the gradient of $\psi(x,y)$ and express it directly in terms of the electric field $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi$ using the Cauchy-Riemann equations. We have
$$
\nabla \psi = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} \mathbf{e}_x + \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \mathbf{e}_y = -\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \mathbf{e}_x + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \mathbf{e}_y = E_y \mathbf{e}_x - E_x \mathbf{e}_y \ .
$$
That is, we have
$$
\mathbf{E}(x,y) = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \mathbf{e}_x - \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} \mathbf{e}_y \ .
$$
Since $\nabla \psi$ is perpendicular to the level curves of $\psi(x,y)$, and since $\mathbf{E} \cdot \nabla \psi = 0$, it must be the case that the electric field lines point along the level curves of the stream function.

We can also express the electric field directly in terms of a the complex derivative of the complex potential $F(z)$. Using the properties of complex derivatives, we can write
$$
\frac{dF}{dz} = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} - i \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} = -E_x + i E_y \ .
$$
Notice if we then take the negative complex conjugate of this derivative, we get a function whose real and imaginary parts are the components of the electric field,
$$
-\bigg(\frac{dF}{dz}\bigg)^* = E_x + i E_y \ .
$$
This is just the complex equivalent of the statement that the electric field is the negative gradient of the potential.

##### Example: Complex potential of an infinite uniformly charged wire

Consider again an infinitely long wire of uniform charge line density $\lambda$ oriented along the $z$-axis. We know the electric field is given in cylindrical coordinates by
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{2\lambda}{\varrho} \mathbf{e}_\varrho \ ,
$$
which implies that the potential is
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = -2\lambda \log\varrho \ .
$$
We'd like to find the complex potential $F(z)$ for this wire in the $xy$-plane. We can then write the ordinary potential in the form
$$
\phi(x,y) = -\lambda \log(x^2 + y^2) \ .
$$
Away from the wire, the potential must satisfy Laplace's equation $\nabla^2 \phi(x,y) = 0$. The associated stream function $\psi(x,y)$ can most easily be found by applying the Cauchy-Riemann equations to $\phi(x,y)$. We have
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} &= \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} = -2\lambda \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} \ , \\
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} &= -\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} = 2\lambda \frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Integrating both sides of these equations, we then get
$$
\begin{align*}
\psi(x,y) &= -2\lambda \int dy \ \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} = -2\lambda \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x} + c_1(x)  \ , \\
\psi(x,y) &= 2\lambda \int dx \ \frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} = 2\lambda \tan^{-1} \frac{x}{y} + c_2(y)  \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Now, observe that we can use a trig identity to write
$$
\tan^{-1} \frac{x}{y} = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x} \ .
$$
This means we must have
$$
\psi(x,y) = -2\lambda \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x} + c_1(x) = 2\lambda \bigg(\frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x}\bigg) + c_2(y) \ .
$$
For these equations to be consistent, we require that $c_1(x)$ and $c_2(y)$ both be constant, with $c_1 = \pi\lambda + c_2$. Any choice of constants will work so long as this equation is satisfied. We'll choose $c_1=0$, so that the stream function can be written
$$
\psi(x,y) = -2\lambda \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x} \ .
$$
This means the complex potential is then
$$
F(z) = \phi(x,y) + i \psi(x,y) = -\lambda \log(x^2 + y^2) - i \ 2\lambda \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x} \ .
$$
We can rewrite this as an explicit function of $z = x+iy$ by observing that in polar coordinates we have
$$
\log z = \log |z| e^{i\varphi} = \log(|z|) + i \varphi = \frac{1}{2} \log(x^2 + y^2) + i \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{x} \ .
$$
Plugging this into the complex potential and simplifying, we finally get
$$
F(z) = -2 \lambda \log z \ .
$$
Surprisingly, the complex potential looks almost identical to the ordinary potential, except with $\varrho$ replaced by $z$.

It's worth mentioning another interesting fact. Notice that in calculating the complex potential for the wire that we're only looking at the projection of the wire onto the $xy$-plane. Since the wire is oriented along the $z$-axis, its projection must be a point charge. This means that the complex potential of a point charge in two dimensions is exactly the same as the complex potential of an infinitely long wire. Indeed, the 2-dimensional Green's function for a point charge $q$ at the origin is $G(\mathbf{x}) = -2 \log \varrho$, which means its potential is $\phi(\mathbf{x}) = -2q \log\varrho$. If we thus set $q = \lambda$ then the two potentials are evidently identical.

### Conformal Mappings

Now, recall that we can also think of any complex function as a geometric transformation acting on the complex plane. That is, any complex function $w = T(z)$ can be thought of as mapping points $z = x + iy$ in the $z$-plane to points $w = u+iv$ in the $w$-plane. When $T(z)$ is analytic in some region of the $z$-plane, these transformations are called *conformal mappings*. Conformal mappings can be shown to preserve the angles between curves under mapping. Moreover, under a conformal mapping the area element $da = dxdy$ merely gets rescaled to a new area element $da' = dudv$ by
$$
du dv = \bigg|\frac{dw}{dz}\bigg|^2 dxdy \ .
$$
Most importantly for our purposes, conformal mappings preserve harmonic functions. That is, if $\phi(u,v)$ is some function that satisfies Laplace's equation in the $w$-plane, then $\phi(x,y) = \phi\big(u(x,y), v(x,y)\big)$ satisfies Laplace's equation in the original $z$-plane, and the boundary conditions are preserved under the transformation $w = T(z)$.

Let's first prove the first part. Suppose $\phi(u,v)$ is harmonic in some region of the $w$-plane, meaning inside this region it satisfies Laplace's equation with respect to $u$ and $v$,
$$
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial u^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial v^2} = 0 \ .
$$
Since $\phi(u,v)$ is harmonic, it must be the real part of some analytic function $F(w) = \phi(u,v) + i\psi(u,v)$ in the $w$-plane. And since the composition of analytic functions is also analytic, then the function
$$
F(T(z)) = \phi\big(u(x,y), v(x,y)\big) + i \psi\big(u(x,y), v(x,y)\big)
$$
must also be analytic in some region of the $z$-plane. In particular, this means the function $\phi(x,y) = \phi\big(u(x,y), v(x,y)\big)$ must also be harmonic in this region of the $z$-plane, hence satisfying Laplace's equation with respect to $x$ and $y$,
$$
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} = 0 \ .
$$
We'll now prove the second part, namely that conformal mappings preserve the boundary conditions. We'll focus on the usual cases where we have Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. The mixed boundary condition case follows from these.

Suppose $\mathcal{C}_z$ is some smooth curve in the $z$-plane that under the conformal mapping $w=T(z)$ maps to another smooth curve $\mathcal{C}_w$ in the $w$-plane. Suppose first that $\phi(u,v) = \phi_0$ is constant along the curve $\mathcal{C}_w$ in the $w$-plane. Clearly then, we have
$$
\phi(x,y) = \phi\big(u(x,y), v(x,y)\big) = \phi_0 \ .
$$
That is, $\phi(x,y)$ will also be constant along the curve $\mathcal{C}_z$ in the $z$-plane. This proves that Dirichlet boundary conditions are preserved under a conformal mapping.

Suppose next that $\partial \phi / \partial n_w = 0$ along the curve $\mathcal{C}_w$ in the $w$-plane, where $\mathbf{n}_w$ is the normal vector to this curve. Since
$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n_w} = \nabla \phi(u,v) \cdot \mathbf{n}_w = 0 \ ,
$$
this can only be true if the curve $\mathcal{C}_w$ is perpendicular to the level curves of $\phi(u,v)$ in the $w$-plane. However, the level curves of $\phi(u,v)$ are the same as the level curves of $\phi(x,y) = \phi\big(u(x,y), v(x,y)\big)$, since constants get mapped to constants under the conformal mapping. This means in the $z$-plane that the level curves of $\phi(x,y)$ will again be perpendicular to the curve $\mathcal{C}_z$. That is, if $\mathbf{n}_z$ is the normal vector to the curve $\mathcal{C}_z$ we must have
$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n_z} = \nabla \phi\big(u(x,y), v(x,y)\big) \cdot \mathbf{n}_z = 0 \ .
$$
This proves that Neumann boundary conditions are preserved under a conformal mapping. By combining these results together, it's possible to show that mixed boundary conditions are also preserved under conformal mappings.

### 2D Boundary Value Problems

The results of the previous section mean that, given some conformal mapping, we essentially have a duality between BVPs in the $xy$-plane and BVPs in the $uv$-plane. If we can somehow find such a conformal mapping that simplifies the problem so that it's much easier to solve in the new space using any of the techniques we've covered so far, we can map it back to get the potential that solves the original BVP.

Of course, the challenging part is finding a conformal mapping $w = T(z)$ that simplifies the given problem. There's an art to this, involving looking at the geometry of the original problem and using that to identify a good transformation that makes the problem easier to solve in a new space. This is best shown by example.

Let's start with a relatively simple BVP that we can solve using methods we've already covered.

##### Example: Long hollow cylinder held at two different potentials

Suppose an infinitely long hollow cylinder of radius $R$ is such that exactly half of the circular cross-section of the cylinder is held at a constant potential $V$, while the other half is grounded. We'll assume each half of the cylinder is separated by a very thin insulating sheet. We'll assume that no other source charges are present inside our outside the cylinder. We're interested in finding the potential at each point inside of the cylinder.

FIGURE (show cylinder with given potentials)

Inside the cylinder the potential must satisfy Laplace's equation. We'll formulate this problem as a BVP in Cartesian coordinates,
$$
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
\nabla^2 \phi(x,y) = 0 \ , \\
\text{where} \ \phi(x,y) = 0 \ \text{when} \ x^2+y^2 = R^2 \ \text{and} \ x > 0  \ , \\
\text{and} \ \phi(x,y) = V \ \text{when} \ x^2+y^2 = R^2 \ \text{and} \ x < 0 \ .
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$
We'll solve this problem two different ways to show that the results agree, first using separation of variables, and second using conformal mappings.

First, recall from the previous chapter that any BVP with cylindrical symmetry, as this problem does, has a solution in cylindrical coordinates of the form
$$
\phi(\varrho,\varphi) = a_0 + b_0 \log\varrho + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \big[(a_n \cos n\varphi + b_n \sin n\varphi)\varrho^n + (c_n \cos n\varphi + d_n \sin n\varphi)\varrho^{-n}\big] \ .
$$
For the potential to stay finite inside the cylinder we require that $b_0 = c_n = d_n = 0$. What remains then is a Fourier series,
$$
\phi(\varrho,\varphi) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty (c_n \cos n\varphi + d_n \sin n\varphi)\varrho^{-n} \ .
$$
The coefficients can be found using standard Fourier series methods. By applying the boundary conditions, one can show that $a_0 =V/2$, $a_n=0$ for all $n$, and $b_n=0$ for all even $n$, while for odd $n$ we have
$$
b_n = -\frac{2V}{n\pi R^n} \quad , \quad n=1,3,5,\cdots \ .
$$
Plugging these in, we get
$$
\phi(\varrho,\varphi) = \frac{V}{2} - \frac{2V}{\pi} \sum_{n=1,3,5,\cdots} \bigg(\frac{\varrho}{R}\bigg)^n \frac{\sin n\varphi}{n} \ .
$$
It turns out this solution can also be written in closed form by using the Taylor expansion of the arctangent function. We get
$$
\phi(\varrho,\varphi) = \frac{V}{2} - \frac{V}{\pi} \tan^{-1} \frac{2R\varrho \sin\varphi}{R^2 - \varrho^2} \ .
$$
Let's now show that we get the same result using conformal mappings. Since the problem is cylindrically symmetric, we know that the solution must only depend on $x$ and $y$. Suppose then that we seek a potential $\phi(x,y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the real and imaginary components of a complex variable $z$. Our goal is to find a conformal mapping $w = T(z)$ that makes $\phi(u,v)$ especially easy to write down in the $w$-plane. To that end, consider the following conformal mapping,
$$
w = -i \frac{z-R}{z+R} \ .
$$
By writing $w = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ and simplifying this expression, it's not hard to show that
$$
u = \frac{2Ry}{(x+R)^2 + y^2} \quad , \quad v = \frac{R^2 - x^2 - y^2}{(x+R)^2 + y^2} \ .
$$
To see why this is a useful conformal mapping to consider, let's look at how the boundary cylinder transforms under the transformation. In the $z$-plane, the boundary cylinder can be parametrized by $z(\varphi) = R e^{i\varphi}$, where $-\pi \leq \varphi \leq \pi$. Under the transformation $w=T(z)$, the cylinder transforms to a curve in the $w$-plane of the form
$$
w(\varphi) = -i \frac{z(\varphi)-R}{z(\varphi)+R} = -i \frac{R e^{i\varphi}-R}{R e^{i\varphi}+R} = -i \frac{e^{i\varphi}-1}{e^{i\varphi}+1} \ .
$$
By multiplying the numerator and denominator by $(e^{i\varphi}+1)^* = e^{-i\varphi}+1$ and simplifying, it's not hard to show that
$$
w(\varphi) = \frac{\sin\varphi}{1 + \cos\varphi} = \tan \frac{\varphi}{2} \ .
$$
This means the cylinder transforms to the curve $u(\varphi) = \tan \varphi / 2$ and $v(\varphi) = 0$ in the $w$-plane. Clearly this is just the real axis in the $w$-plane. When $-\pi < \varphi < 0$ the curve runs from $u=-\infty$ to $u=0$, and when $0 < \varphi < \pi$ the curve runs from $u=0$ to $u=\infty$. What we've managed to do with this conformal mapping is transform the surface of the cylinder in the $z$-plane into the $u$-axis in the $w$-plane. Moreover, the interior of the cylinder in the $z$-plane gets mapped to the upper half of the $w$-plane.

What about the boundary conditions? If $\phi(x,y) = 0$ on the cylinder when $x > 0$, under the conformal mapping we must have $\phi(u,0) = 0$ when $u > 0$. Similarly, if $\phi(x,y) = V$ on the cylinder when $x < 0$, we must have $\phi(u,0) = V$ when $u < 0$. The points $x = \pm R$ in the $z$-plane where these two parts of the cylinder joint both map to $w = 0$. In the figure below we show a visualization of this mapping, including the boundary conditions.

FIGURE (show this conformal mapping with BCs included)

We now have an equivalent BVP to solve in the $w$-plane,
$$
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
\nabla^2 \phi(u,v) = 0 \ , \\
\text{where} \ \phi(u,0) = 0 \ \text{when} \ u > 0 \ , \\
\text{and} \ \phi(u,0) = V \ \text{when} \ u < 0 \ .
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$
So how do we find such a potential? The trick is to find a function $\phi(w) = \phi(u,v)$ that's analytic in the upper half-plane while also satisfying the boundary conditions. If the function is analytic we know it must satisfy Laplace's equation, and if it satisfies the boundary conditions we know it must be the unique solution. To that end, let's try to guess a solution. Consider the function
$$
\phi(w) = \frac{V}{\pi} \text{Arg} \ w \ ,
$$
where $\text{Arg} \ w$ is the phase of $w$, or equivalently the angle of the point $w = u+iv$ in the $w$-plane relative to the positive $u$-axis. First, notice that $\phi(w)$ satisfies the boundary conditions, since $\text{Arg} \ w = 0$ along the positive $u$-axis and $\text{Arg} \ w = \pi$ along the negative $u$-axis. Moreover, the function is analytic in the upper half plane $v > 0$ since $f(w) = \text{Arg} \ w$ is analytic when $v > 0$. This guarantees that $\phi(w) = \phi(u,v)$ satisfies Laplace's equation in the upper half plane. By the uniqueness theorem then, this must be the unique solution that solves the given BVP in the $w$-plane.

We now need only transform back to the $z$-plane to get the original potential $\phi(x,y)$ we seek. To do this we need to express the phase $\text{Arg} \ w$ as a function of $x$ and $y$. Since the phase of a product is the sum of their phases, we have
$$
\text{Arg} \ w = \text{Arg} \bigg(-i \frac{z-R}{z+R}\bigg) = \text{Arg} \ i - \text{Arg} \ \frac{z-R}{z+R} \ .
$$
Now, $\text{Arg} \ i = \pi/2$, and the phase of the second term is just the arctangent of its imaginary part divided by its real part, which turns out to be given by
$$
\text{Arg} \ \frac{z-R}{z+R} = \tan^{-1} \frac{2yR}{R^2 - x^2 - y^2} \ .
$$
Plugging this back into the potential, we have
$$
\phi(x,y) = \frac{V}{\pi} \bigg[\frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1} \frac{2yR}{R^2 - x^2 - y^2}\bigg] \ .
$$
Or, expressed in cylindrical coordinates, we have
$$
\phi(\varrho,\varphi) = \frac{V}{2} - \frac{V}{\pi} \tan^{-1} \frac{2R \varrho\sin\varphi}{R^2 - \varrho^2} \ .
$$
This is of course exactly the result we found above using separation of variables. It's fair to ask if the use of complex methods made this problem any easier than just using separation of variables. In one sense, we replaced the need to solve a PDE with the algebra of complex variables. But in another sense we needed to be a lot more clever. For complex methods to be useful we need to be able to guess a conformal mapping that simplifies the problem. In this case we were able to do that, but it's not always so obvious how to even find such a mapping. There are, however, problems that are much harder to solve using other methods where complex methods happen to be quite helpful. We'll see an example of this next.

## Cartesian Multipole Expansion

We will now turn our attention away from boundary value problems and consider again the problem of a localized charge distribution sitting somewhere in space, free of boundary surfaces like conductors or whatever. We know that in this setting we can formally express the potential as an integral
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \frac{\rho(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
The hard part is actually solving this integral for a general charge distribution $\rho(\mathbf{x}')$. It would be nice then if we could find a systematic way to approximate the potential as a series in inverse powers of the distance of the field point from the charge distribution. Provided we can find such an expansion, we can often find a good approximate solution when we're far away from the source charges by considering the first few expansion terms. This sort of expansion is called a *multipole expansion*.

### Derivation

Based on intuition and past examples, we expect that very far away from the charge distribution the potential should be approximately that of a point charge, falling off like $1/r$ when $r \gg r'$. But we've also seen potentials that fall off like $1/r^2$ as well. In fact, we can find charge distributions with potentials that fall off like $1/r^n$ for *any* positive integer $n$. 

Since the only part of the integrand that depends on the field point $\mathbf{x}$ is the Green's function $G(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}')$, it suffices to find an expression of the Green's function in powers of $1/r$. Provided we can do this, we can plug the expansion back into the integral formula for the potential and get an expansion for the potential in powers of $1/r$.

Assuming a scalar field $f(\mathbf{x})$ is infinitely differentiable at some point $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}_0$, we can Taylor expand the function about this point. It's not hard to see using index notation that this expansion will take the following form,
$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} (\mathbf{x} \cdot \nabla)^n f(\mathbf{x}_0) = f(\mathbf{x}_0) + \mathbf{x} \cdot \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0) + \frac{1}{2} x_i x_j \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_j \partial x_i} \bigg|_{\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}_0} + \cdots \ .
$$
We'd like to now Taylor expand the Green's function $G(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}')$, assuming $\mathbf{x}'$ is the expansion variable and $\mathbf{x}$ is the expansion point of interest. It's not hard to see this will be given by
$$
G(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}') = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} (\mathbf{x}' \cdot \nabla)^n G(\mathbf{x}) = G(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{x}' \cdot \nabla G(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{1}{2} x_i' x_j' \frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial x_j \partial x_i} + \cdots \ .
$$
If we now let $G(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}') = 1/|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|$, then $G(\mathbf{x}) = 1/r$, and so we can write
$$
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} (\mathbf{x}' \cdot \nabla)^n \frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{r} - \mathbf{x}' \cdot \nabla \frac{1}{r} + \frac{1}{2} x_i x_j \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_j \partial x_i} \frac{1}{r} + \cdots \ .
$$
Now, recall that $\nabla 1/r = -\mathbf{x} / r^3$ and notice that
$$
x_i' x_j' \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_j \partial x_i} \frac{1}{r} = x_i' x_j' \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_j \partial x_i} (x_k x_k)^{-1/2} = x_i' x_j' \frac{3 x_i x_j - r^2 \delta_{ij}}{r^5} \ .
$$
Up to the quadratic term, we can thus expand the Green's function in vector notation as
$$
\boxed{
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = \frac{1}{r} + \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x}'}{r^3} + \frac{3 (\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x}')^2 - r^2 r'^2}{2r^5} + \cdots 
} \ .
$$
We've thus managed to expand the Green's function in powers of $1/r$, at least up to the quadratic term. We could keep going if we like. In fact the expansion above is just a binomial expansion, so it's not difficult. We'll defer the full expansion to later.

Plugging this Green's function expansion back into the integral for the potential, we get
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \bigg[\frac{1}{r} + \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x}'}{r^3} + \frac{3 (\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x}')^2 - r^2 r'^2}{2r^5} + \cdots\bigg] \ .
$$
Notice that, apart from the quadratic term, we can group the source-dependent terms together inside each integral to write
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{r} \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') + \frac{\mathbf{x}}{r^3} \cdot \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \mathbf{x}' + \frac{1}{2r^5} \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') [3 (\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x}')^2 - r^2 r'^2] + \cdots \ .
$$
The fact that the integrals of the first two terms depend only on the source suggests we give those a name. The first integral, which is evidently just the total charge of the distribution, we'll call the *monopole moment* $q$,
$$
q \equiv \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \ .
$$

Notice that this means the first expansion term is just $q/r$, which agrees with our prior intuition that a charge distribution should act as a point charge in the far field limit, so long as $q \neq 0$. Its corrections will just be the next expansion terms.

The second integral is evidently a vector depending only on the source distribution. We'll call it the *dipole moment* $\mathbf{p}$,
$$
\mathbf{p} \equiv \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \mathbf{x}' \ .
$$
In its current form the third integral doesn't depend solely on the sources. We'll deal with that later. For now, just note that we can express this third term in the form
$$
\frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{2r^5} = \frac{x_i x_j Q_{ij}}{2r^5} \ ,
$$
where $\mathbf{Q}$ is a rank-2 tensor called the *quadrupole moment* whose components are given by
$$
Q_{ij} = \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') [3 x_i' x_j' - r'^2 \delta_{ij}] \ .
$$
All of these moments are called *multipole moments*. We'll explain the physical meaning behind each of these in more detail in the following sections. For now, just note that using these multipole moments we can re-write the potential expansion in the form
$$
\boxed{
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{q}{r} + \frac{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{r^3} + \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{2r^5} + \cdots
} \ .
$$
This is the Cartesian *multipole expansion*. Let's now look more deeply at each of these expansion terms one by one.

### Monopole Moment

Substituting in the monopole moment $q$, we can write the first term in the multipole expansion simply as
$$
\boxed{
\phi^{(0)}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{q}{r} 
} \ .
$$
This is called the *monopole potential*. Clearly it falls off like $1/r$. Recall the monopole moment $q$ is given by
$$
\boxed{
q \equiv \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') }
 \ .
$$
Evidently, the monopole moment represents the *total net charge* of the distribution.

Since the electric field is $\mathbf{E}^{(0)} = -\nabla \phi^{(0)}$, the *monopole field* $\mathbf{E}^{(0)}$will be given by Coulomb's Law, with
$$
\mathbf{E}^{(0)}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{q}{r^2} \mathbf{x} \ .
$$
The field lines for the monopole look exactly as we'd expect. We show a plot of these field lines below to compare with the field lines of the higher order multipole terms in the next few sections. As usual, the field lines are assume to point outward for a positive point charge, and inward for a negative point charge.

![](../resources/image-20241108234730808.png){fig-align=center width=400}

Naturally, the best physical model of the monopole moment is just a point charge $q$ centered at the origin, which exactly reproduces the field lines shown above.

Since this is the first term in the multipole expansion, we should expect that very far away from the charge distribution, the potential should approximate the of a point charge with total net charge $q$. Of course, this is only true if $q \neq 0$. If $q=0$, we have to proceed to the next term in the multipole expansion, the dipole potential.

### Dipole Moment

Substituting in the definition for the second multipole moment $\mathbf{p}$, we can write the second term in the multipole expansion as
$$
\boxed{
\phi^{(1)}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{r^3} 
} \ .
$$
We call this expansion term the *dipole potential*. This potential falls off like $1/r^2$. The dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$ is a *vector* given by

$$
\mathbf{p} \equiv \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \mathbf{x}' \ .
$$
Notice that the dipole moment, like all multipole moments, depends *only* on the source charges. It does not depend at all on the field point. Thus, the dipole moment captures all relevant information about the source charges in this expansion term. As defined, the dipole moment evidently has dimensions of charge times distance. In particular, this means we should always expect the components of the dipole moment to go like $qd$, where $d$ is some characteristic length scale.

By writing $\mathbf{E}^{(1)} = -\nabla \phi^{(1)}$ in index notation and plugging in the dipole potential above, while keeping in mind that $\mathbf{p}$ doesn't depend on $\mathbf{x}$, one can show that the *dipole field* $\mathbf{E}^{(1)}$ can be written as
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{E}^{(1)}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{3(\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - r^2 \mathbf{p}}{r^5}
} \ .
$$
Notice that, while the dipole potential falls off like $1/r^2$ that, the dipole field falls off like $1/r^3$, as we'd expect.

The field lines of the dipole field are those of a *pure dipole*, shown below. Unlike the field lines of the monopole field, the field lines of the dipole field never terminate at infinity except along the axis of the dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$. The other field lines instead wrap back around on the source in the opposite direction.

##### Example: Physical dipole

We want to now try to get an idea of what the dipole physically says about a charge distribution. To that end let's consider the following simple problem. Suppose we have two opposite point charges $+q$ and $-q$ separated from each other by a distance $d$ along some axis, say the $z$-axis to keep things simple. We'll suppose the $+q$ charge is at the point $\mathbf{x}_+ = d/2 \mathbf{e}_z$ and the $-q$ charge is at the point $\mathbf{x}_- = -d/2 \mathbf{e}_z$. We call this the *physical dipole*.

By the superposition principle, the *exact* potential of the physical dipole is given by
$$
\begin{align*}
\phi(\mathbf{x}) &= \frac{q}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_+|} - \frac{q}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_-|} \\
&= q\bigg[\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-d/2)^2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+d/2)^2}}\bigg] \ ,
\end{align*}
$$
and the *exact* E-field of the physical dipole is given by
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) &= q\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_+}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_+|^3} - q\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_-}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_-|^3} \\
&= q \bigg[\frac{\mathbf{x} - d/2 \ \mathbf{e}_z}{[x^2 + y^2 + (z-d/2)^2]^{3/2}} - \frac{\mathbf{x} + d/2 \ \mathbf{e}_z}{[x^2 + y^2 + (z+d/2)^2]^{3/2}}\bigg] \ .
\end{align*}
$$
As formidable as this look, we can still plot the field lines numerically. Below is a plot of these field lines for the physical dipole, with the $+q$ charge shown in red and the $-q$ charge shown in blue. As always, the field lines go from positive charges to negative charges, and the equipotential curves are tangent to the field lines.

![](../resources/image-20241103010905701.png){fig-align=center width=400}

Compare these field lines for the physical dipole to those of the *pure dipole* field $\mathbf{E}^{(1)}$ given before. Notice that near the source charges they two fields look nothing alike, but far away from the point charges the field lines look basically the same.

To connect the two, let's calculate the monopole and dipole potentials for the physical dipole. First, notice that there is no net charge since $q-q = 0$. This means there won't be a monopole potential contribution. We'll thus proceed to the dipole term.

To find the dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$, notice that $\rho(\mathbf{x}') = q \delta(\mathbf{x}' - \mathbf{x}_+) - q \delta(\mathbf{x}' - \mathbf{x}_-)$, which means we have
$$
\mathbf{p} = \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \mathbf{x}' = q(\mathbf{x}_+ - \mathbf{x}_-) = qd \mathbf{e}_z \ .
$$
This means the dipole potential is
$$
\phi^{(1)}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{r^3} = \frac{qd}{r^2} \cos\theta \ .
$$
In the far field limit $r \gg d$ we expect that $\phi(\mathbf{x}) \approx \phi^{(1)}(\mathbf{x})$. This can be confirmed through more effort by doing a binomial expansion of $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ in powers of $d/r$ and confirming we get the same result to leading order.

Is it possible to create a physical dipole whose potential is *exactly* that of the pure dipole, where $\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \phi^{(1)}(\mathbf{x})$ exactly? Sort of. Informally, we could achieve this by essentially placing the two charges right on top of each other. That is, we let $d \to 0$ while keeping the dipole moment $|\mathbf{p}| = qd$ fixed. While we can imagine doing this mathematically, physically it's a bit non-sensical, since to let $d \to 0$ we'd also have to let $q \to \infty$ just as quickly.

Note that there's nothing special about the $z$-axis in this problem. We can orient the dipole along any axis we like. If the two opposite charges are separated by some vector $\mathbf{d}$, their dipole moment will be
$$
\mathbf{p} = q \mathbf{d} \ .
$$
This means the dipole moment will always point along the axis of the charges, in the direction of the positive charge.

---

In fact, we can model the dipole moment of an arbitrary charge distribution in a similar way. Suppose $\rho(\mathbf{x}')$ is some arbitrary charge distribution. If we imagine the distribution consists of a bunch of discrete point charges, each positively or negatively charged, we can decompose $\rho(\mathbf{x}')$ into a positively charge distribution $\rho_+(\mathbf{x}')$ and negatively charge distribution $\rho_-(\mathbf{x}')$ as
$$
\rho(\mathbf{x}') = \rho_+(\mathbf{x}') + \rho_-(\mathbf{x}') \ ,
$$
where $\rho_\pm(\mathbf{x}')$ is a sum over $N_\pm$ positive or negative charges $q_i^{\pm}$ located at positions $\mathbf{x}_i^\pm$,
$$
\rho_\pm(\mathbf{x}') = \sum_{i=1}^{N_\pm} q_i^\pm \delta(\mathbf{x}' - \mathbf{x}_i^\pm) \ .
$$
We can now do an averaging process over these two distributions. The average charge $q_\pm$ of each distribution will be
$$
q_\pm \equiv \frac{1}{N_\pm} \sum_{i=1}^{N_\pm} q_i^\pm
$$
The average position of these charges will be their *center of charges* $\mathbf{x}_\pm$, given by
$$
\mathbf{x}_\pm \equiv \frac{1}{N_\pm} \sum_{i=1}^{N_\pm} q_i^+ \mathbf{x}_i^\pm \ .
$$
This means the total net charge is $q_+ - q_-$, and the average separation between the $q_+$ and $q_-$ is
$$
\mathbf{d} \equiv \mathbf{x}_+ - \mathbf{x}_- \ .
$$
The dipole moment of $\rho(\mathbf{x}')$ can thus also be written as
$$
\mathbf{p} = q_+ \mathbf{x}_+ - q_- \mathbf{x}_- \ .
$$
In the special case that the total net charge is zero, then $q \equiv q_+ = -q_-$, in which case we get $\mathbf{p} = q \mathbf{d}$, which is exactly what we derived above for the physical dipole in the far field limit. In this sense then, we can think of the dipole moment as representing the average charge polarization of a given charge distribution.

##### Example: Dipole moment of an azimuthally symmetric hollow sphere of charge

Consider a hollow spherical shell of radius $R$ with a polar-dependent surface charge density of the form $\sigma' = k \cos\theta'$. We'd like to find the dipole moment and potential associated with this distribution.

First, notice that this distribution has no net charge, since the monopole moment is
$$
q = \int da' \ \sigma' = 2\pi R^2 k \int_0^\pi d\theta' \ \cos\theta' = 0 \ .
$$
This means the first term in the multipole expansion *must* be at least a dipole potential. Let's now calculate the dipole moment. Notice first that the charge density is azimuthally symmetric about the $z$-axis. This means the dipole potential must point along the $z$-direction, with $\mathbf{p} = p_z \mathbf{e}_z$. It thus suffices to calculate only the $p_z$ component of the dipole moment. We have
$$
p_z = \int da' \ \sigma' z' = \int_0^\pi R^2 \sin\theta' d\theta' \ k R \cos^2\theta' = \frac{4\pi}{3} k R^3 \ .
$$
With the dipole moment in hand we can now calculate the dipole potential. Evidently, we have
$$
\phi^{(1)}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{r^3} = \frac{p_z \cos\theta}{r^2} = \frac{4\pi}{3} kR \cos\theta \bigg(\frac{R}{r}\bigg)^2 \ .
$$
Since there is no monopole moment, this means in the far field limit the full potential can be approximated by
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) \approx \frac{4\pi}{3} kR \cos\theta \bigg(\frac{R}{r}\bigg)^2 \ .
$$
In fact, this is the *exact* potential for this charge distribution. We calculated the exact potential for this distribution in the previous chapter and got the exact same result.

We can calculate the associated electric field as well, which is
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{E}^{(1)}(\mathbf{x}) =  \frac{3(\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r) \mathbf{e}_r}{r^3} - \frac{\mathbf{p}} {r^3} = \frac{4\pi}{3} k \bigg(\frac{R}{r}\bigg)^3 \bigg(3\cos\theta \mathbf{e}_r - \mathbf{e}_z\bigg) \ .
$$
As expected, the electric field falls off like $1/r^3$, with field lines coming out from the top of the sphere (which we can think of as a $+q$ charge, and going into the bottom of the sphere (which we can think of as a $-q$ charge).

FIGURE (sketch the field lines of this sphere, showing it looks like a dipole)



### Quadrupole Moment

Finally, let's look at the quadratic term in the multipole expansion, which we had last written in the form
$$
\phi^{(2)}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{1}{2r^5} \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') [3 (\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x}')^2 - r^2 r'^2] \ .
$$
This is called the *quadrupole potential*. Recall that we also defined the quadrupole moment $\mathbf{Q}$, whose components are
$$
Q_{ij} \equiv \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \bigg[3 x_i' x_j' - r'^2 \delta_{ij}\bigg] \ .
$$
Notice that $x_i' x_j'$ is just the components of the outer product $\mathbf{x}' \otimes \mathbf{x}'$, $\delta_{ij}$ is just the components of the identity tensor $\mathbf{1}$. This means we can also write the quadrupole moment in abstract notation as
$$
\mathbf{Q} \equiv \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \bigg[3 \mathbf{x}' \otimes \mathbf{x}' - r'^2 \mathbf{1}\bigg] \ .
$$
Since the outer product and the identity tensor are both valid rank-2 tensors, the quadrupole moment, or *quadrupole tensor*, is clearly a rank-2 tensor as well by the superposition principle. Its components have dimensions of charge times distance squared, or charge times area. This means we should always expect the components of the quadrupole moment to go like $qd^2$, where $d$ is some characteristic length scale.

Notice from the definition that the quadrupole tensor is clearly symmetric since both the outer product and the identity tensor are symmetric. That is, $Q_{ij} = Q_{ji}$. Moreover, the quadrupole tensor is also *traceless*. That is, its diagonal sum $Q_{ii} = 0$. To see why, observe that
$$
Q_{ii} = \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \bigg[3 x_i' x_i' - r'^2 \delta_{ii}\bigg] = \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \bigg[3 r'^2 - 3 r'^2\bigg] = 0 \ .
$$
Here, we used the fact that $r'^2 = x_i' x_i'$ and the diagonal sum of the $3 \times 3$ identity tensor is $\delta_{ii} = 3$.

We've thus shown that the quadrupole tensor is a symmetric, traceless tensor of rank-2. Such a tensor is usually called an *irreducible tensor*. These conditions together imply that, while the quadrupole tensor has $3^2 = 9$ total components, it only has $3^2 - 3 - 1 = 5$ independent components. This is due to the fact that the symmetric condition makes three of the off-diagonal components redundant, while the tracelessness condition makes one of the diagonal components redundant.

We'll now show that we can express the quadrupole potential explicitly in terms of the quadrupole moment as
$$
\phi^{(2)}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{x_i x_j Q_{ij}}{2r^5} \ .
$$
First, let's take the expression for the quadrupole potential we had before and re-express it in index notation,
$$
\phi^{(2)}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2r^5} \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \bigg[3 (x_i x'_i) (x_j x_j') - r^2 r'^2\bigg] \ .
$$
We want the pull all dependence on $\mathbf{x}$ out of the integrand. We can do this be factoring $x_i x_j$ out of the first term, but if we do that we need to insert a $\delta_{ij}$ into the second term. We then have
$$
\phi^{(2)}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{x_i x_j}{2r^5} \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \bigg[3 x_i' x_j' - r'^2 \delta_{ij}\bigg] \ .
$$
Notice now that the remaining integral is just the $Q_{ij}$ component of the quadrupole tensor. We thus have
$$
\phi^{(2)}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{Q_{ij} x_i x_j}{2r^5} \ .
$$
This is precisely what we wanted to show. We can express this in abstract notation by noticing that $Q_{ij} x_i x_j$ is just the index notation representation of the quadratic form $\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{x}$, which is just the scalar $\mathbf{x} \cdot (\mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. The dipole potential thus becomes
$$
\boxed{
\phi^{(2)}(\mathbf{x}) =\frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{2r^5} 
} \ .
$$
We've thus completed our derivation of the Cartesian multipole expansion we wrote above,
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{q}{r} + \frac{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{r^3} + \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{2r^5} + \cdots \ .
$$
To find the associated quadrupole field $\mathbf{E}^{(2)}(\mathbf{x})$ we again need only use the relation $\mathbf{E}^{(2)} = -\nabla \phi^{(2)}$. After a bit of algebraic manipulation, one can show that the quadrupole field can be expressed in abstract notation as
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{E}^{(2)}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{5 (\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - 2r^2(\mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{x})}{2r^7}
} \ .
$$
As expected, the quadrupole field falls off like $1/r^4$. A plot of the field lines is shown below. Notice that, like the dipole field, most of the field lines begin and end at the source, with the exception of the field lines along the diagonal.

##### Example: Physical Quadrupole

To get a handle as to what the quadrupole is saying about a charge distribution we'll do the same thing we did with the dipole, consider a toy problem involving a simple configuration of point charges. Suppose four point charges of the same magnitude $q$ are laid out in a square whose sides have a length $d$. Suppose the square is centered at the origin of the $yz$-plane, with the charges laid out as follows:

- A charge $+q$ located at position $\mathbf{x}_1 = (0, d/2, d/2)$,
- A charge $-q$ located at position $\mathbf{x}_2 = (0, d/2, -d/2)$,
- A charge $+q$ located at position $\mathbf{x}_3 = (0, -d/2, -d/2)$,
- A charge $-q$ located at position $\mathbf{x}_4 = (0, -d/2, d/2)$.

We call a charge configuration of this kind a *physical quadrupole*. By the principal of superposition, the exact potential of this charge configuration is evidently
$$
\begin{align*}
\phi(\mathbf{x}) &= \frac{q}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_1|} - \frac{q}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_2|} + \frac{q}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_3|} - \frac{q}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_4|} \\
&= q\bigg[\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + (y-d/2)^2 + (z-d/2)^2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + (y-d/2)^2 + (z+d/2)^2}} \\
&- \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + (y+d/2)^2 + (z-d/2)^2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + (y+d/2)^2 + (z+d/2)^2}}\bigg] \ ,
\end{align*}
$$
and the exact E-field is
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) &= q\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_1|^3} - q\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_2}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_2|^3} + q\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_3}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_3|^3} - q\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_4}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_4|^3} \\
&= q\bigg[\frac{\mathbf{x} - d/2 (\mathbf{e}_y + \mathbf{e}_z)}{\sqrt{x^2 + (y-d/2)^2 + (z-d/2)^2}} - \frac{\mathbf{x} - d/2 (\mathbf{e}_y - \mathbf{e}_z)}{\sqrt{x^2 + (y-d/2)^2 + (z+d/2)^2}} \\
&- \frac{\mathbf{x} + d/2 (\mathbf{e}_y + \mathbf{e}_z)}{\sqrt{x^2 + (y+d/2)^2 + (z-d/2)^2}} + \frac{\mathbf{x} + d/2 (\mathbf{e}_y - \mathbf{e}_z)}{\sqrt{x^2 + (y+d/2)^2 + (z+d/2)^2}}\bigg] \ .
\end{align*}
$$
As complicated as this looks, we can still plot the field lines numerically. Below is a plot of these field lines, with the positive charges are shown in red and the negative charges in blue. As usual, the equipotentials curves are tangential to the field lines.

![](../resources/image-20241103012027269.png){fig-align=center width=400}

Now, compare this plot to the ones shown for the *pure quadrupole* previously. Close to the charges the field lines look nothing alike, while far away from the point charges they look practically identical, exactly like we saw with the physical dipole before. This suggests that the physical quadrupole may provide a good approximation to the pure quadrupole in the far field limit $r \gg d$.

We can confirm this by showing that this charge configuration has no monopole or dipole moment. Since the charges all sum to zero, there's clearly no monopole moment. The dipole moment also vanishes, since
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{p} &= q \mathbf{x}_1 - q \mathbf{x}_2 + q \mathbf{x}_3 - q \mathbf{x}_4 \\
&= q \big[[\mathbf{x} - d/2 (\mathbf{e}_y + \mathbf{e}_z)] - [\mathbf{x} - d/2 (\mathbf{e}_y - \mathbf{e}_z)] + [\mathbf{x} + d/2 (\mathbf{e}_y + \mathbf{e}_z)] - [\mathbf{x} + d/2 (\mathbf{e}_y - \mathbf{e}_z)]\big] \\

&= \mathbf{0} \ .

\end{align*}
$$
This means when $r \gg d$ the exact potential $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ must fall off *at least* like $1/r^3$. In fact in this limit it falls off *exactly* like $1/r^3$. We can confirm this by calculating its quadrupole moment and confirm it's non-vanishing. It's not hard to see that each component of the quadrupole moment will be given by the sum
$$
Q_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^4 q_k \bigg[3 x_i^{(k)} x_j^{(k)} - r_k^2 \delta_{ij}\bigg] \ ,
$$
where $x_i^{(k)}$ is the $i$<sup>th</sup> component of $\mathbf{x}_k$ and $r_k^2 = \mathbf{x}_k \cdot \mathbf{x}_k$.

First, notice that the diagonal components of this tensor all vanish since ???



Now, notice that the $x$-component $x^{(k)}$ of each $\mathbf{x}_k$ is zero. Since $\delta_{ij} = 0$ when $i \neq j$, this means each off diagonal $Q_{xj} = 0$.

So what does the quadrupole moment represent physically? As we did with the dipole moment, we'll consider a simple charge configuration, and show that in a certain limit its potential becomes the quadrupole potential. Consider then a configuration of point charges consisting of two oppositely oriented but parallel physical dipoles. We assume the charges inside each dipole is separated by a distance $d$, and that the charge on each dipole is separated by the charge on the opposite dipole by the same distance $d$. This will lead to a configuration of four opposite point charges $\pm q$ arranged as shown below.

FIGURE

We call this configuration of charges the *physical quadrupole*. First, notice that the physical quadrupole has no net charge, since all the charges sum to zero. Second, notice it also has no net dipole moment, since it consists of two opposite dipole moments $\pm q\mathbf{d}$, which cancel each other when added together. These together evidently imply that whatever terms remain in the potential must fall off at least like $1/r^3$ in the limit $d \ll r$.



We can again proceed as we did with the physical dipole and take a binomial expansion of the roots when $d \ll r$. The end result of all the algebra is that in the far field limit we can approximate the potential of the physical quadrupole as
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) \approx \frac{3qd^2 yz}{r^5} \ .
$$
Evidently, in the far field limit the potential of the physical quadrupole goes like $1/r^3$, which suggests the lowest expansion term of this potential is a quadrupole potential. However, since this approximation depends on $yz$, it appears that only the $Q_{yz}$ and $Q_{zy}$ components of the quadrupole moment appear to contribute anything to the potential. We can see this by writing
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) \approx \frac{3d^2 yz}{r^5} = \frac{Q_{yz} yz}{2r^5} + \frac{Q_{zy} zy}{2r^5} \ .
$$
Evidently, we have $Q_{yz} = Q_{zy} = 3qd^2$. The remaining components of $\mathbf{Q}$ all vanish, leaving us with the quadrupole matrix
$$
\mathbf{Q} = 3 qd^2\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix} \ .
$$
Just as we did with the physical dipole, we can model the behavior of the physical quadrupole in the far field limit by considering an idealized physical quadrupole where we let $d \to 0$ while keeping $qd$ finite. This will give a potential completely equivalent to that of the physical quadrupole in the far field limit, since the higher order multipole terms all vanish. We call this idealized version of the physical quadrupole the *pure quadrupole*. The potential of the pure quadrupole is exactly the quadrupole potential.

Just as the physical dipole suggested something about what the dipole moment physically represents, the physical quadrupole suggests something about what the quadrupole moment physically represents. Notice each component of the quadrupole moment above is proportional to $qd^2$, where $d$ is the separation distance between the charges. This means the quadrupole moment is saying something about the *spread* of the charge distribution. The more spread out the distribution is, the higher the quadrupole moment will be. 

However, it's slightly more complicated than this. To see why, recall the uniformly charged hollow sphere of radius $R$. We showed that outside the sphere its potential is given by $\phi(\mathbf{x}) = q/r$, where $q = 4\pi R^2 \sigma$ is the total charge on the sphere. This is an exact result, which evidently means the uniformly charged sphere has only one non-vanishing multipole moment, the monopole moment. This implies that both its dipole moment and quadrupole moment must be zero. Yet, if the quadrupole moment truly represented the spread of the charge distribution, we'd expect its components to go like $qR^2$.

So what's going on here? As it turns out, the quadrupole moment *also* measures the *anisotropy* of the charge distribution, or how much it deviates from being a sphere. The less spherical the distribution is, the more of a quadrupole moment it will have. We should thus *really* think of the quadrupole moment as a measure of a charge distribution's spread and anisotropy.

Let's now work an example to show how to calculate the quadrupole moment for a slightly more complicated charge distribution.

##### Example: Uniformly charged ring

Suppose we have a uniformly charged circular ring with radius $a$ and line charge density $\lambda$. We'll assume that the ring is centered at the origin in the $xy$-plane. Clearly the ring has a net charge given by $q = 2\pi a \lambda$, which means its potential must have a monopole contribution. It does not, however, have a dipole moment. This can be seen from symmetry. The ring clearly has no preferred direction in the $xy$-plane since it's circular and uniformly charged, which means it can't have a dipole moment.

But does it have a quadrupole moment? This isn't so clear from symmetry alone, so let's calculate it explicitly. To do so we need to keep in mind we're working with a one-dimensional distribution, which means $dq = \lambda d\ell'$. Each component of the quadrupole moment will thus be given by the integral
$$
Q_{ij} = \int d\ell' \ \lambda(\mathbf{x}') \bigg[3 x_i' x_j' - r'^2 \delta_{ij}\bigg] \ .
$$
Along the ring, $\lambda$ is constant, $r' = a$ is constant, and the line element is just $d\ell' = a d\varphi'$. We're thus left to evaluate
$$
Q_{ij} = 3a\lambda \int_0^{2\pi} d\varphi' \ x_i' x_j' - a^3 \lambda \delta_{ij} \int_0^{2\pi} d\varphi' \ .
$$
The second integral is clearly just $2\pi a^3 \lambda \delta_{ij}$, or equivalently $qa^2 \delta_{ij}$. To evaluate the first integral we need to switch to polar coordinates, which means we'll need to be explicit about which components we're calculating. 

Let's calculate $Q_{xx}$ first. Since $x' = a \cos\varphi'$ and $\delta_{xx} = 1$, we have 
$$
\begin{align*}
Q_{xx} &= 3a\lambda \int_0^{2\pi} d\varphi' \ a^2 \cos^2\varphi' - 2\pi a^3 \lambda \\
&= 3\pi a^3 \lambda - 2\pi a^3 \lambda \\
&= \pi a^3 \lambda \\
&= \frac{1}{2} qa^2 \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Similarly, it's easy to see we must get $Q_{yy} = qa^2 / 2$ as well. The vanishing trace property of the quadrupole tensor then implies we must have $Q_{zz} = -Q_{xx} - Q_{yy} = -qa^2$ for the remaining diagonal component.

Next, we need to find $Q_{xy}$. Since $y' = a\sin\varphi'$ and $\delta_{xy} = 0$, we have
$$
Q_{xy} = 3a\lambda \int_0^{2\pi} d\varphi' \ a^2 \cos\varphi' \sin\varphi' = 0 \ .
$$
This immediately implies $Q_{yx} = 0$ as well since the quadrupole tensor is symmetric. Last, observe $Q_{xz} = Q_{yz} = 0$ since for these components both the first and second integrals must vanish.

We thus have a quadrupole tensor $\mathbf{Q}$ with non-vanishing terms only along the diagonal,
$$
\mathbf{Q} = \frac{1}{2} qa^2\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -2
\end{pmatrix} \ .
$$
With these moments in hand, we can now calculate the multipole expansion for the charged ring,
$$
\begin{align*}
\phi(\mathbf{x}) &= \frac{q}{r} + \frac{Q_{xx} x^2 + Q_{yy} y^2 + Q_{zz} z^2}{2r^5} + \cdots \\
&= \frac{q}{r} + \frac{qa^2(x^2 + y^2 - 2z^2)}{4r^5} + \cdots \ .
\end{align*}
$$
So how do we know this expansion is correct? One way to check is to calculate the exact potential in some simple direction. In this case, the clear choice is to choose the axis of symmetry, the $z$-axis. We can calculate the exact potential along the $z$-axis very easily from the integral formula. In fact we did that in the previous chapter, where we got
$$
\phi(z) = \frac{q}{\sqrt{a^2 + z^2}} = \frac{q}{z} - \frac{qa^2}{2z^3} + \cdots \ .
$$
Clearly this agrees with the expansion derived above when $x = y = 0$. However, the expansion derived above works for *any* field point, not just those along the $z$-axis. Indeed, we already have a good approximation to the potential for the ring when $r \gg z$. So long as we're far enough away from the ring the higher order moments are negligible. It's really in this sense that the multipole expansion is most useful in practice.

### Higher-Order Moments

- Use general Green's function expansion to argue each term contains a moment that's a rank-$n$ tensor
- Sketch out the common form for the $n$th multipole potential
- Maybe say a brief word about irreducibility, leaving most of this for the next section
- Be careful writing out the general term. Get the $\ell$'s right. May be better to do $\ell+1$ or something. Figure it out.

$$
\frac{x_i x_j x_k \mathcal{O}_{ijk}}{6r^7} \quad , \quad \frac{x_{i_1} \cdots x_{i_\ell} \mathcal{Q}_{i_1 \cdots i_\ell}}{(\ell+1)! r^{2\ell}}
$$

### Charges in External Fields

Thus far, we've derived the multipole expansion for a localized charge distribution in free space, with no other external fields present. We'd now like to introduce an external E-field and examine the potential energy of a localized charge distribution in the presence of this field in terms of its multipole moments. We'll assume the external field is strong enough that we can neglect any self fields produced by the charge distribution itself.

To that end, suppose we have a charge distribution $\rho(\mathbf{x})$ localized around the origin. In the background we assume there's an external E-field $\mathbf{E}_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x})$ whose potential is $\phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x})$. Clearly the external field will itself be generated by some other charge distribution $\rho_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x})$, but we'll assume it's far enough away from $\rho(\mathbf{x})$ that we can ignore it.

We assume the external charge distribution is unknown. To that end, it doesn't make sense to do a multipole expansion of $\phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x})$, but we can still do a Taylor expansion about the origin,
$$
\begin{align*}
\phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) &= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} (\mathbf{x} \cdot \nabla)^n \phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{0}) \\
&= \phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{0}) + \mathbf{x} \cdot \nabla \phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} + \frac{1}{2} x_i x_j \partial_i \partial_j \phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} + \cdots \\
&= \phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{0}) - \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{E}_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{0}) - \frac{1}{2} x_i x_j \partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} + \cdots \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Note in the last line we used the relation $\mathbf{E}_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) = -\nabla \phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x})$ to simplify the expansion somewhat. Now, recall the potential energy $U$ on a charge distribution due to an external E-field is given by
$$
U = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \ ,
$$
where the region $\mathcal{V}$ is the enclosed volume of the charge distribution $\rho(\mathbf{x})$. If we plug in the Taylor expansion for the external potential into this integral and group terms, we get
$$
\begin{align*}
U &= \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \\
&= \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \bigg[\phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{0}) - \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{E}_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{0}) - \frac{1}{2} x_i x_j \partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} + \cdots\bigg] \\
&= \phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{0}) \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{E}_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{0}) \cdot \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - \frac{1}{2} \partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) x_i x_j + \cdots \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Note we pulled all field-dependent terms outside the integral since they don't depend on $\mathbf{x}$. Now, notice the first integral is just the monopole moment $q$ of the charge distribution, and the second integral is its dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$. Clearly the final integral should somehow be related to the quadrupole moment $Q_{ij}$. Indeed, observe if we contract $Q_{ij}$ with $\partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \big|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}}$ we get
$$
\begin{align*}
Q_{ij} \partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} &= \partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) [3 x_i x_j + \delta_{ij} r^2] \\
&= 3 \partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) x_i x_j + \delta_{ij} \partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) r^2 \\
&= 3 \partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) x_i x_j + (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}_{\text{ext}}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) r^2 \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Now, by Gauss's law we know $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}_{\text{ext}} = 4\pi \rho_{\text{ext}}$. Since we're only interested inside $\mathcal{V}$ though we have $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}_{\text{ext}} = 0$. Thus, we get
$$
\partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) x_i x_j = \frac{1}{3} Q_{ij} \partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \ .
$$
Putting this all together now, we finally have the potential energy expansion of a charge distribution in an external E-field,
$$
\boxed{
U = q \phi_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{0}) - \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{E}_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{0}) - \frac{1}{6} Q_{ij} \partial_i E_j^{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{x}) \bigg|_{\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}} + \cdots
} \ .
$$
In particular, notice that if the E-field is *uniform* inside $\mathcal{V}$ with constant value $\mathbf{E}_0$, we can write
$$
U = q \phi_0 - \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{E}_0 \ ,
$$
where $\phi_0$ is some chosen ground potential.

## Spherical Multipole Expansion

We've now studied the first few terms of the multipole expansion in depth. In practice these are often the only terms we care about when finding an approximate expansion of the potential of some given. Nevertheless, it's illuminating to find the general multipole expansion for all powers of $1/r$, not just the first few. We will do that now, first considering the special case of azimuthally symmetric charge distributions before proceeding the more general distributions.

### Green's Function Expansion

We can also write the Green's function in the following form,
$$
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = \frac{1}{r} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (r'/r)^2 - 2 (r'/r) \cos\alpha}} \ .
$$
We then used the binomial expansion in the limit $r \gg r'$ to find an expansion of the Green's function up to the first few terms. 

We'll now do something slightly more clever. Recall from the appendix that we *defined* the Legendre polynomials $P_\ell(x)$ to be the expansion coefficients of the following *generating function* $g(x,t)$ when expanded in powers of $t$,
$$
g(x,t) \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + t^2 - 2xt}} = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty P_\ell(x) t^\ell \ .
$$
Now, notice that this generating function looks exactly like the Green's function, except with $t = r'/r$ and $x = \cos\alpha$. This means we immediately have an expansion of the Green's function in powers of $1/r$ given by

$$
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty P_\ell(\cos\alpha) \bigg(\frac{r'}{r}\bigg)^\ell \ .
$$
As written, this is the most general possible expansion of the Green's function in powers of $1/r$. Let's make sure that this agrees with the expansion we derived before up to the first few terms. First, let's recall the first few Legendre polynomials are
$$
P_0(\cos\alpha) = 1 \quad , \quad P_1(\cos\alpha) = \cos\alpha \quad , \quad P_2(\cos\alpha) = \frac{1}{2} (3 \cos^2\alpha - 1) \ .
$$
Expanding the Green's function up to the quadratic term and plugging these in, we have
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} &= P_0(\cos\alpha) \frac{1}{r} + P_1(\cos\alpha) \frac{r'}{r^2} + P_2(\cos\alpha) \frac{r'^2}{r^3} + \cdots \\
&= \frac{1}{r} + \cos\alpha \frac{r'}{r^2} + \frac{1}{2} (3 \cos^2\alpha - 1) \frac{r'^2}{r^3} + \cdots \ .
\end{align*}
$$
This is exactly what we derived before when deriving the first few terms of the Cartesian multipole expansion.

If we plug this Green's function expansion back into the integral for the potential, we then get
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\rho(\mathbf{x}')}{r} \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty P_\ell(\cos\alpha) \bigg(\frac{r'}{r}\bigg)^\ell \ .
$$
Collecting the source-dependent terms all together, this becomes
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \frac{1}{r^{\ell+1}} \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') P_\ell(\cos\alpha) r'^\ell \ .
$$
Now, the remaining integrals depend both on $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}'$, since the angle $\alpha$ between them depend on both points. This means we can't exactly identify these integrals with the multipole moment just yet. Instead we'll break this into two cases. First we'll consider the case of azimuthally symmetric distributions, and then proceed to more general distributions.

### Azimuthally Symmetric Expansion

Let's first consider the special case where the charge distribution is azimuthally symmetric, so that $\rho(\mathbf{x}') = \rho(r, \theta)$. 



- This is turning out to be a lot harder and more subtle than expected.
- Really the only thing I *need* from this expansion are the scalar multipole moments. Is there an easier way?
- It may be easier to derive the general expansion first and do this as a special case, where $m=0$ for all $\ell$.
- Don't forget to show the first non-vanishing moment is origin independent. Use spherical harmonics for this.


$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{r_>} \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty c_\ell \bigg(\frac{r_<}{r_>}\bigg)^\ell P_\ell(\cos\theta) \ .
$$
$$
\int d\theta \ \phi(\mathbf{x}) P_{\ell'}(\cos\theta) = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty c_\ell \frac{r'^\ell}{r^{\ell+1}} \frac{2}{2\ell+1} \delta_{\ell\ell'}
$$

$$
\int d\theta \ \phi(\mathbf{x}) P_{\ell}(\cos\theta) = c_\ell \frac{r'^\ell}{r^{\ell+1}} \frac{2}{2\ell+1}
$$

$$
c_\ell = \frac{2\ell+1}{2} \frac{r^{\ell+1}}{r'^\ell} \int_{0}^{2\pi} d\theta \ \phi(\mathbf{x}) P_\ell(\cos\theta)
$$





We now want to eliminate the explicit dependent on $\cos\alpha$. We can do that by making use of the *addition theorem* of spherical harmonics. We proved in the appendix that we can expand $P_\ell(\cos\alpha)$ in terms of the spherical harmonics by
$$
P_\ell(\cos\alpha) = \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1} \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi) Y_{\ell m}^*(\theta',\varphi') \ .
$$
If we plug this back into the Green's function, we get
$$
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1} \bigg(\frac{r'}{r}\bigg)^\ell \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi) Y_{\ell m}^*(\theta',\varphi') \ .
$$
Notice that this expansion is now over two indices, $\ell$ and $m$. For each $\ell$ there will be $2\ell+1$ terms in the sum indexed by $m$.

We'll call this version of the Green's function expansion in spherical coordinates the *exterior* expansion. The exterior expansion is valid whenever $r > r'$. It's worth mentioning that this derivation in terms of the generating function is completely symmetric under an interchange of $r$ and $r'$. This means we can also get an *interior* expansion of the Green's function when $r < r'$ by
$$
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = \frac{1}{r'} \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1} \bigg(\frac{r}{r'}\bigg)^\ell \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi) Y_{\ell m}^*(\theta',\varphi') \ .
$$
Indeed, it's common to combine these two expressions together by letting $r_< \equiv \min(r,r')$ and $r_> \equiv \max(r,r')$, and writing
$$
\boxed{
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = \frac{1}{r_>} \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1} \bigg(\frac{r_<}{r_>}\bigg)^\ell \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi) Y_{\ell m}^*(\theta',\varphi')
} \ .
$$
We won't need this more general expansion to derive the spherical multipole expansion. It's just worth being aware of, since this expansion can occasionally be used to solve various boundary value problems.

### Spherical Expansion

If we plug the exterior Green's function expansion back into the integral formula for the potential, we get
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\rho(\mathbf{x}')}{r} \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1} \bigg(\frac{r'}{r}\bigg)^\ell \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi) Y_{\ell m}^*(\theta',\varphi') \ .
$$
Now, notice that only the term $r'^\ell Y_{\ell m}^*(\theta',\varphi')$ depend on the source points $\mathbf{x}'$. We'll thus define the quantities
$$
q_{\ell m} \equiv \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') r'^\ell Y_{\ell m}^*(\theta',\varphi') \ .
$$
These quantities are the only terms in the expansion that depend on the source points. They're called the *spherical multipole moments*. These moments aren't *exactly* the usual multipole moments, but they're related to them in ways we'll show shortly. At any rate, if we substitute $q_{\ell m}$ in for this integral, we can finally write
$$
\boxed{
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1} \frac{1}{r^{\ell+1}} \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell q_{\ell m} Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi) 
} \ .
$$
As written, this is the most general form of the multipole expansion. We usually call the multipole expansion in this form the *spherical multipole expansion* since it involves an expansion in spherical coordinates.

Before proceeding, it's worth briefly recalling a few properties of spherical harmonics. First, $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi)$ and $Y_{\ell,-1m}(\theta,\varphi)$ are related by the formula $Y_{\ell,-m}(\theta,\varphi) = (-1)^m Y_{\ell m}^*(\theta,\varphi)$. This evidently implies that the moment $q_{\ell m}$ is related to the moment $q_{\ell,-m}$ by $q_{\ell,-m} = (-1)^m q_{\ell m}^*$. The first few spherical harmonics when $\ell=0,1,2$ are given by
$$
\begin{align*}
Y_{00}(\theta,\varphi) &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi}} \ , \quad

\begin{cases}
Y_{1,-1}(\theta,\varphi) &= \sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}} \sin\theta e^{-i\varphi} \\
Y_{10}(\theta,\varphi)& = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}} \cos\theta \\
Y_{11}(\theta,\varphi) &= -\sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}} \sin\theta e^{i\varphi} \\
\end{cases} \ , \quad

\begin{cases}
Y_{2,-2}(\theta,\varphi) &= \sqrt{\frac{15}{32\pi}} \sin^2 \theta e^{-2i\varphi} \\
Y_{2,-1}(\theta,\varphi) &= \sqrt{\frac{15}{8\pi}} \sin\theta \cos\theta e^{-i\varphi} \\
Y_{20}(\theta,\varphi) &= \sqrt{\frac{5}{16\pi}} (3\cos^2 \theta - 1) \\
Y_{21}(\theta,\varphi) &= -\sqrt{\frac{15}{8\pi}} \sin\theta \cos\theta e^{i\varphi} \\
Y_{22}(\theta,\varphi) &= \sqrt{\frac{15}{32\pi}} \sin^2 \theta e^{2i\varphi} \\
\end{cases} \ .
\end{align*}
$$


We now want to show that the spherical multipole expansion agrees with the basic multipole expansion when $\ell=0,1,2$. Let's proceed case by case. When $\ell = 0$, we only have one term, $m=0$. The moment $q_{00}$ is evidently given by
$$
q_{00} = \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') Y_{00}^*(\theta',\varphi') = \frac{q}{\sqrt{4\pi}} \ ,
$$
where $q$ is the usual monopole moment, or total net charge of the distribution. The $\ell=0$ expansion term is then just the monopole potential,
$$
\phi_0(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{q}{r} \ .
$$
Next, when $\ell = 1$ we have $m=-1,0,1$. The associated multipole moments are evidently then
$$
\begin{align*}
q_{10} &= \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') r' Y_{10}^*(\theta',\varphi') = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') r' \cos\theta \ , \\
q_{1,\pm1} &= \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') r' Y_{1,\pm 1}^*(\theta',\varphi') = \mp \sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}}\int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') r' \sin\theta e^{\mp i\varphi} \ .
\end{align*}
$$
If we write $e^{\pm i\varphi} = \cos\varphi \pm i \sin\varphi$, and use the formulas to convert spherical coordinates $(r',\theta',\varphi')$ to Cartesian coordinates $(x',y',z')$, we get
$$
\begin{align*}
q_{10} &= \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') r' \cos\theta = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') z' \ , \\
q_{1,\pm 1} &= \mp \sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}} \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') r' \sin\theta (\cos\varphi \mp i \sin\varphi) = \mp \sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}} \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') (x' \mp iy') \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Now, notice that the remaining terms in each integral are just the components of the dipole vector $\mathbf{p}$, with
$$
q_{10} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}} p_z \quad , \quad
q_{1,\pm 1} = \mp \sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}} (p_x \mp i p_y) \ .
$$
Then the $\ell=1$ terms in the spherical multipole expansion are
$$
\begin{align*}
\phi_1(\mathbf{x}) &= \frac{4\pi}{3r^2} \big[q_{1,-1} Y_{1,-1}(\theta,\varphi) + q_{10} Y_{10}(\theta,\varphi) + q_{11} Y_{11}(\theta,\varphi)\big] \\
&= \frac{4\pi}{3r^2} \bigg[\frac{3}{8\pi} \sin\theta e^{-i\varphi} (p_x + i p_y) + \frac{3}{4\pi} \cos\theta p_z + \frac{3}{8\pi} \sin\theta e^{i\varphi} (p_x - i p_y) \bigg] \\
&= \frac{1}{r^2} \bigg[\frac{1}{2} \sin\theta e^{-i\varphi} (p_x + i p_y) + \cos\theta p_z + \frac{1}{2} \sin\theta e^{i\varphi} (p_x - i p_y)\bigg] \\
&= \frac{1}{r^2} \big[x p_x + y p_y + z p_z \big] \ .
\end{align*}
$$
In the last step we again used the fact that $e^{\pm i\varphi} = \cos\varphi \pm i \sin\varphi$. When this is plugged in and we simplify terms, we find that the imaginary parts all vanish. The remaining real parts then contain terms that turn out to be the Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$. What remains in brackets is clearly just the dot product between $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{p}$. We thus end up with the usual dipole potential,
$$
\phi_1(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{r^2} \ .
$$
Finally we'll consider the $\ell=2$ expansion terms. In this case $m=-2,-1,0,1,2$, which means there will be five terms. Using the same logic we did with the dipole term, one can show that these spherical moments can be written in the form

$$
\begin{align*}
q_{20} &= \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{5}{4\pi}} Q_{zz} \ , \\
q_{2,\pm 1} &= \mp \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{\frac{15}{8\pi}} (Q_{xz} \mp 2i Q_{yz}) \ , \\
q_{2,\pm 2} &= \frac{1}{12} \sqrt{\frac{15}{2\pi}} (Q_{xx} - Q_{yy} \mp 2i Q_{xy}) \ ,
\end{align*}
$$
where each $Q_{ij}$ are the components of the usual quadrupole tensor $\mathbf{Q}$. By plugging these into the $\ell=2$ expansion term and simplifying as before, we eventually end up with the usual quadrupole potential,
$$
\phi_2(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{Q_{ij} x_i x_j}{2r^5} = \frac{\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{2 r^5} \ .
$$
This shows that the spherical multipole expansion agrees with the basic multipole expansion up to $\ell=2$. One could proceed to derive higher order multipole moments and potentials from this expansion as well. For example, by expanding the $\ell=3$ terms one can derive the octupole moment and octupole potential.
