# Magnetostatics

Now that we've spent a considerable amount of time covering the topic of electrostatics and the basic concepts of electric fields, we will now move to the topic of magnetostatics and the concepts of magnetic fields. Magnetostatics can informally be thought of as the magnetic analogue of electrostatics. Whereas in electrostatics we were interested in the behavior of *electric fields* due to static *charges*, in magnetostatics we're interested in the behavior of *magnetic fields* due to static *currents*. We will approach this new topic in much the same way we approached electrostatics, by first defining the force between two wires of steady current, and then abstracting from that the notion of the magnetic field. We will then use the properties of the magnetic field to derive the field equations of magnetostatics, and show that these can be cast in terms of a single equation for the *vector potential*, which is the magnetic analogue of the scalar potential from electrostatics.

## Magnetism

Magnetism as a qualitative subject is at least as old as electricity. It was known even in ancient times that there were certain stones whose filings tended to point north. In the 16th century, Gilbert used an iron needle to create the first compass for navigation. Nowadays we call these special kinds of metals *ferromagnets*. The ferromagnets found in nature consist primarily of either iron, cobalt, or nickel. To really understand how ferromagnets work requires quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. We will just briefly summarize their behavior. 

When a ferromagnetic material is brought into the presence of a magnetic field and heated to a suitable temperature, the spins of the electrons inside the material tend on average to align themselves in the direction of the magnetic field. When the temperature is lowered again, these spins stay locked in the same direction, causing the material to become ferromagnetic. By convention, we call the direction of the aligned spins the *north pole* of the magnet, and the opposite direction the *south pole*.

By analogy with electrostatics, we can think of a ferromagnet is a kind of dipole, with the north pole being analogous to the positive polarization direction of the dipole and the south pole being analogous to the negative polarization direction. As with charges, we say that two like poles repel each other and two opposite poles attract each other. The most important difference here though is that we cannot separate a ferromagnet into distinct poles. No matter how finely we chop it up, the magnet will *always* contain *both* a north pole and a south pole, since an electron always contains a spin. Indeed, this one difference is probably the most important in the difference in the properties of electricity and magnetism.

Just as an electric dipole has a dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$, we'll assume that the ferromagnet has a *magnetic dipole moment*. From quantum mechanics, the magnetic dipole moment $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ of a single electron with spin $\mathbf{S}$ is given by the formula
$$
\boldsymbol{\mu} = \gamma \mathbf{S} \ ,
$$
where the proportionality constant $\gamma$ is the *gyromagnetic ratio* of an electron, about $-1.8 \cdot 10^7$ in Gaussian units. To a very good approximation, we can ignore the spin contributions from the nuclei in calculating the total dipole moment and use only the electron dipole moments. By the principle of superposition, we thus define the magnetic dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$ of the ferromagnet as the vector sum of the dipole moments $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i$ of each electron inside the material,
$$
\mathbf{m} \equiv \sum_i \boldsymbol{\mu}_i = \gamma \sum_i \mathbf{S}_i \ .
$$
By definition, the dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$ evidently points in the same direction as the sum total of all the electron spins $\mathbf{S}_i$, but in the opposite direction due to the minus sign in $\gamma$. By convention, we agree that the dipole moment points from the south pole of the magnet to the north pole of the magnet, which means the total spin evidently points in the opposite direction.

With the dipole moment defined, it thus makes sense to *define* the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})$ of a ferromagnet analogously to the electric field of an electric pure dipole,
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{3(\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - r^2 \mathbf{p}}{r^5} \quad \leftrightarrow \quad \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{3(\mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - r^2 \mathbf{m}}{r^5} \ .
$$
As with the electric dipole, this is strictly speaking an abstraction. It's only when the distance between the north and south pole of the magnet is much less than the distance to the field point $\mathbf{x}$. The field lines for such a *pure* magnetic dipole must then look identical to the field lines of the pure electric dipole.

##### Example: Measuring the Earth's magnetic field

When a ferromagnet is placed in the vicinity of an magnetic field, it will tend to align itself in the direction of the field. In particular, this means that the ferromagnet will experience a torque due to the presence of the magnetic field. This torque $\mathbf{N}$ turns out to be given by the cross product of the magnetic dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$ with the external magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_0$,
$$
\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}_0 \ .
$$
Now suppose we take as the ferromagnet a small iron needle, which we could place on a mechanical swivel to create a magnetic compass. Due to the torque above, the needle will rotate until its north pole is aligned with the external magnetic field. Provided that external field is generated by the Earth itself, this field will point toward the north pole of the Earth itself.

FIGURE (show one needle setup)

Suppose both the needle and the external field each lie in the $xy$-plane, which we could to be the surface of the earth. Suppose the needle is located at the origin, and the external field points along the positive $x$-axis, which we'll take to be north. If $\varphi$ is the counterclockwise angle between the needle and the positive $x$-axis, then we can write
$$
\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}_0 = -mB_0 \sin\varphi \mathbf{e}_z \ ,
$$
where $m = |\mathbf{m}|$ and $B_0 = |\mathbf{B}_0|$. This means the torque will evidently point along the negative $z$-axis. We can write the magnitude of the torque $|\mathbf{N}| = I \ddot\varphi$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the needle. Plugging this in and dividing through by $I$, we end up with the following equation of motion for the needle,
$$
\ddot\varphi + \frac{mB_0}{I} \sin\varphi = 0 \ .
$$
Those familiar with classical mechanics will recognize this as the equation of motion for the simple pendulum which oscillates at an angular frequency
$$
\omega \equiv \sqrt{\frac{mB_0}{I}} \ .
$$
Evidently, the needle will oscillate forever about the north pole with this frequency, just as a pendulum would. In practice this indefinite oscillation isn't noticed, since for a real compass the swivel has friction, which causes the oscillations to dampen relatively quickly, causing the needle to come to rest in the direction of the external field. In the case of navigation, this external magnetic field is created by the Earth due to the motion of molten iron inside the Earth's core.

We can actually design a simple experiment to measure the value of the Earth's magnetic field. Suppose again that magnetic field is $\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0 \mathbf{e}_x$, but instead of one needle we have two. The first needle will be the same as before, with dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$. The second needle will be a test needle. Suppose the first needle is located at the origin and already in equilibrium with the external field, so that $\mathbf{m} = m \mathbf{e}_y$. We'll place the second test needle at the point $\mathbf{d} = d \mathbf{e}_y$, with the north pole pointed in the $y$-direction.

FIGURE (show two needle setup)

Now, since the first needle is a magnetic dipole, it will generate its own magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ given approximately by
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{3(\mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - r^2 \mathbf{m}}{r^5} \ .
$$
By the principle of superposition, this means the external field felt by the test needle will be the *combined* field $\mathbf{B}_0 + \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})$ at the field point $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{d}$. At this point, we can simplify the field generated by the first needle as
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{d}) = \frac{3(\mathbf{m} \cdot d\mathbf{e}_y) d\mathbf{e}_y - d^2 \mathbf{m}}{d^5} = \frac{2m}{d^3} \mathbf{e}_y \ .
$$
The combined field will cause a torque on the test needle, causing it to move in the direction of $\mathbf{B}_0 + \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{d})$. Now, suppose $\alpha$ is the angle between the combined field and the external field $\mathbf{B}_0$. We can express this angle in terms of $d$, $m$, and $B_0$ by
$$
\tan\alpha = \frac{B}{B_0} = \frac{2m}{d^3 B_0} \ .
$$
This relation provides a way to determine $B_0$, provided we already know $\alpha$, $m$, and $d$. The challenge experimentally is that the magnetic field generated by the first needle will be very small, which means the deviation angle $\alpha$ will be very tiny. This simple method, known as the *Gaussian method*, has been used to experimentally measure the magnetic field strength $B_0$ of the Earth.

---

We can use the relations found in the previous example to determine the units of the magnetic field and dipole moment, in Gaussian units. First, notice the equation $\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}_0$ implies the product $m B_0$ must have units of torque, or equivalently units of energy. Second, notice from the equation for $\tan\alpha$ that the ratio $m/B_0$ must have units of $d^3$, or volume. Combined, these together allow us to determine the units of both $m$ and $B_0$. Evidently, $B_0^2$ has units of energy per unit volume, or energy density, and $m^2$ has units of energy times volume.

Recall in Gaussian units that the squared charge has units of energy times length. This means the magnetic field must have units of charge per length squared, or equivalently units of electric field. The magnetic dipole moment must have units of charge times length, or units of electric dipole moment. Thus, the electric and magnetic fields and dipole moments have the *same* units in the Gaussian unit system. This hints at a strong relationship between electricity and magnetism, which we'll explore shortly.

In Gaussian units, the unit of magnetic field strength is called the *Gauss*, with $1 \ \text{G} = 10^{-4} \ \text{T}$, where the *Tesla* is the SI unit equivalent. To get an idea for scales, the Earth's magnetic field strength is about $0.5 \ \text{G}$. A typical refrigerator magnet has a field strength of around $10 \ \text{G}$. A very large magnet, like say an MRI machine, has a field strength of $10^4-10^5 \ \text{G}$, or $1-10 \ \text{T}$.

## Current

If this were all there was to magnetism we wouldn't have much more to say about the subject. However, it turns out that ferromagnets are not the only things that generate magnetic fields. It turns out electric currents also produce magnetic fields.





Indeed, it was discovered in the 19th century that magnetic forces were caused by *electric current*, or moving electric charge. This discovery was first observed by Oersted, who noticed that if he placed a compass in the vicinity of a current carrying wire that the needle tended to align itself in a direction perpendicular to the wire. This discovery linked electricity and magnetism together for the first time, enabling the two phenomena to be unified into one framework.

A few years later, Ampere observed that if two parallel current carrying wires were placed near each other, they tended to attract or repel each other depending on whether the currents were aligned or anti-aligned. Moreover, Ampere observed that the force per unit length of wire is inversely proportional to the distance between the wires. More formally, suppose two parallel wires each of length $L$ are placed at some distance $r$ apart. Suppose a current of $I_1$ flows through one wire, and a current of $I_2$ flows through the second wire. Then the force strength of attraction between them is given by
$$
\frac{F}{L} = 2 k_m \frac{I_1 I_2}{r} \ ,
$$
where $k_m$ is a proportionality constant known as the *magnetic constant*. Its value and form depend on the choice of units used. In the Gaussian system of units, we take $k_m \equiv 1/c^2$, where $c \approx 3 \cdot 10^{10} \ \text{cm/sec}$ is the speed of light in vacuum. The appearance of the speed of light in this constant is indeed no coincidence. We'll see where it comes from in a later chapter.


$$
I \equiv \frac{dq}{dt} = qv
$$

$$
\mathbf{J} = \rho \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial q}{\partial t \partial a} \mathbf{n}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0 
} \ .
$$



### Lorentz Force Law




$$
\mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathbf{I}}{c} \times \mathbf{B}
$$

$$
\mathbf{F} = q \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B}
$$

$$
\mathbf{F} = q \bigg(\mathbf{E} + \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B}\bigg)
$$

$$
\mathbf{F} = \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \bigg(\rho(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})}{c} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})\bigg)
$$

- Magnetic forces do no work, since $\mathbf{v}$ is always perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$. Can only change direction, not kinetic energy.



## Biot-Savart Law


$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}') \times \mathbf{x}}{cr^3}
$$

$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d\ell' \ \frac{\mathbf{I}(\mathbf{x}') \times \mathbf{x}'}{cr^3}
$$

$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \int da' \ \frac{\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}') \times \mathbf{x}'}{cr^3}
$$





## Ampere's Law




$$
\boxed{
\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \frac{4\pi}{c} I_{\text{enc}}
} \ .
$$

$$
\boxed{
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J}
} \ .
$$





## Vector Potential


$$
\mathbf{B} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}
$$

$$
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3\mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|}
$$





## Multipole Expansion


$$
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{cr^3} + \cdots
$$




## Field Energy


$$
U = - \mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{B} + \cdots
