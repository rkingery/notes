# Magnetostatics

Now that we've spent a considerable amount of time covering the topic of electrostatics and the basic concepts of electric fields, we will now move to the topic of magnetostatics and the concepts of magnetic fields. Magnetostatics can informally be thought of as the magnetic analogue of electrostatics. Whereas in electrostatics we were interested in the behavior of *electric fields* due to static *charges*, in magnetostatics we're interested in the behavior of *magnetic fields* due to static *currents*. We will approach this new topic in much the same way we approached electrostatics, by first defining the force between two wires of steady current, and then abstracting from that the notion of the magnetic field. We will then use the properties of the magnetic field to derive the field equations of magnetostatics, and show that these can be cast in terms of a single equation for the *vector potential*, which is the magnetic analogue of the scalar potential from electrostatics.

## Ampere's Force Law

Magnetism as a qualitative subject is at least as old as electricity. It was known even in ancient times that there were certain *ferromagnetic* materials which tended to align themselves with the Earth's magnetic field. Indeed, the word *magnet* derives from *Magnesia*, an area in Ancient Greece where ferromagnetic materials were found. However, a quantitative description of magnetism took longer to find than it did for electricity. This owes primarily to the fact that magnetism doesn't have a notion of *magnetic charge*. Indeed, it was discovered in the 19th century that magnetic forces were caused by *electric current*, or moving electric charge. This discovery was first observed by Oersted, who noticed that if he placed a compass in the vicinity of a current carrying wire that the needle tended to align itself in a direction perpendicular to the wire.

A few years later, Ampere observed that if two parallel current carrying wires were placed near each other, they tended to attract or repel each other depending on whether the currents were aligned or anti-aligned. Moreover, Ampere observed that the force per unit length of wire is inversely proportional to the distance between the wires. More formally, suppose two parallel wires each of length $L$ are placed at some distance $r$ apart. Suppose a current of $I_1$ flows through one wire, and a current of $I_2$ flows through the second wire. Then the force strength of attraction between them is given by
$$
\frac{F}{L} = 2 k_m \frac{I_1 I_2}{r} \ ,
$$
where $k_m$ is a proportionality constant known as the *magnetic constant*. Its value and form depend on the choice of units used. In the Gaussian system of units, we take $k_m \equiv 1/c^2$, where $c \approx 3 \cdot 10^{10} \ \text{cm/sec}$ is the speed of light in vacuum. The appearance of the speed of light in this constant is indeed no coincidence. We'll see where it comes from in a later chapter.
