# Magnetostatics

Now that we've spent a considerable amount of time covering the topic of electrostatics and the basic concepts of electric fields, we will now move to the topic of magnetostatics and the concepts of magnetic fields. Magnetostatics can informally be thought of as the magnetic analogue of electrostatics. Whereas in electrostatics we were interested in the behavior of *electric fields* due to static *charges*, in magnetostatics we're interested in the behavior of *magnetic fields* due to static *currents*. We will approach this new topic in much the same way we approached electrostatics, by first defining the force between two wires of steady current, and then abstracting from that the notion of the magnetic field. We will then use the properties of the magnetic field to derive the field equations of magnetostatics, and show that these can be cast in terms of a single equation for the *vector potential*, which is the magnetic analogue of the scalar potential from electrostatics.

## Magnetism

Magnetism as a qualitative subject is at least as old as electricity. It was known even in ancient times that there were certain stones whose filings tended to point north. In the 16th century, Gilbert used an iron needle to create the first compass for navigation. Nowadays we call these special kinds of metals *ferromagnets*. The ferromagnets found in nature consist primarily of either iron, cobalt, or nickel. To really understand how ferromagnets work requires quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. We will just briefly summarize their behavior. 

When a ferromagnetic material is brought into the presence of a magnetic field and heated to a suitable temperature, the spins of the electrons inside the material tend on average to align themselves in the direction of the magnetic field. When the temperature is lowered again, these spins stay locked in the same direction, causing the material to become ferromagnetic. By convention, we call the direction of the aligned spins the *north pole* of the magnet, and the opposite direction the *south pole*.

By analogy with electrostatics, we can think of a ferromagnet is a kind of dipole, with the north pole being analogous to the positive polarization direction of the dipole and the south pole being analogous to the negative polarization direction. As with charges, we say that two like poles repel each other and two opposite poles attract each other. The most important difference here though is that we cannot separate a ferromagnet into distinct poles. No matter how finely we chop it up, the magnet will *always* contain *both* a north pole and a south pole, since an electron always contains a spin. Indeed, this one difference is probably the most important in the difference in the properties of electricity and magnetism.

Just as an electric dipole has a dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$, we'll assume that the ferromagnet has a *magnetic dipole moment*. From quantum mechanics, the magnetic dipole moment $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ of a single electron with spin $\mathbf{S}$ is given by the formula
$$
\boldsymbol{\mu} = \gamma \mathbf{S} \ ,
$$
where the proportionality constant $\gamma$ is the *gyromagnetic ratio* of an electron, about $-1.8 \cdot 10^7$ in Gaussian units. To a very good approximation, we can ignore the spin contributions from the nuclei in calculating the total dipole moment and use only the electron dipole moments. By the principle of superposition, we thus define the magnetic dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$ of the ferromagnet as the vector sum of the dipole moments $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i$ of each electron inside the material,
$$
\mathbf{m} \equiv \sum_i \boldsymbol{\mu}_i = \gamma \sum_i \mathbf{S}_i \ .
$$
By definition, the dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$ evidently points in the same direction as the sum total of all the electron spins $\mathbf{S}_i$, but in the opposite direction due to the minus sign in $\gamma$. By convention, we agree that the dipole moment points from the south pole of the magnet to the north pole of the magnet, which means the total spin evidently points in the opposite direction.

With the dipole moment defined, it thus makes sense to *define* the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})$ of a ferromagnet analogously to the electric field of an electric pure dipole,
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{3(\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - r^2 \mathbf{p}}{r^5} \quad \leftrightarrow \quad \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{3(\mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - r^2 \mathbf{m}}{r^5} \ .
$$
As with the electric dipole, this is strictly speaking an abstraction. It's only when the distance between the north and south pole of the magnet is much less than the distance to the field point $\mathbf{x}$. The field lines for such a *pure* magnetic dipole must then look identical to the field lines of the pure electric dipole.

##### Example: Measuring the Earth's magnetic field

When a ferromagnet is placed in the vicinity of an magnetic field, it will tend to align itself in the direction of the field. In particular, this means that the ferromagnet will experience a torque due to the presence of the magnetic field. This torque $\mathbf{N}$ turns out to be given by the cross product of the magnetic dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$ with the external magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_0$,
$$
\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}_0 \ .
$$
Now suppose we take as the ferromagnet a small iron needle, which we could place on a mechanical swivel to create a magnetic compass. Due to the torque above, the needle will rotate until its north pole is aligned with the external magnetic field. Provided that external field is generated by the Earth itself, this field will point toward the north pole of the Earth itself.

FIGURE (show one needle setup)

Suppose both the needle and the external field each lie in the $xy$-plane, which we could to be the surface of the earth. Suppose the needle is located at the origin, and the external field points along the positive $x$-axis, which we'll take to be north. If $\varphi$ is the counterclockwise angle between the needle and the positive $x$-axis, then we can write
$$
\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}_0 = -mB_0 \sin\varphi \mathbf{e}_z \ ,
$$
where $m = |\mathbf{m}|$ and $B_0 = |\mathbf{B}_0|$. This means the torque will evidently point along the negative $z$-axis. We can write the magnitude of the torque $|\mathbf{N}| = I \ddot\varphi$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the needle. Plugging this in and dividing through by $I$, we end up with the following equation of motion for the needle,
$$
\ddot\varphi + \frac{mB_0}{I} \sin\varphi = 0 \ .
$$
Those familiar with classical mechanics will recognize this as the equation of motion for the simple pendulum which oscillates at an angular frequency
$$
\omega \equiv \sqrt{\frac{mB_0}{I}} \ .
$$
Evidently, the needle will oscillate forever about the north pole with this frequency, just as a pendulum would. In practice this indefinite oscillation isn't noticed, since for a real compass the swivel has friction, which causes the oscillations to dampen relatively quickly, causing the needle to come to rest in the direction of the external field. In the case of navigation, this external magnetic field is created by the Earth due to the motion of molten iron inside the Earth's core.

We can actually design a simple experiment to measure the value of the Earth's magnetic field. Suppose again that magnetic field is $\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0 \mathbf{e}_x$, but instead of one needle we have two. The first needle will be the same as before, with dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$. The second needle will be a test needle. Suppose the first needle is located at the origin and already in equilibrium with the external field, so that $\mathbf{m} = m \mathbf{e}_y$. We'll place the second test needle at the point $\mathbf{d} = d \mathbf{e}_y$, with the north pole pointed in the $y$-direction.

FIGURE (show two needle setup)

Now, since the first needle is a magnetic dipole, it will generate its own magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ given approximately by
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{3(\mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - r^2 \mathbf{m}}{r^5} \ .
$$
By the principle of superposition, this means the external field felt by the test needle will be the *combined* field $\mathbf{B}_0 + \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})$ at the field point $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{d}$. At this point, we can simplify the field generated by the first needle as
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{d}) = \frac{3(\mathbf{m} \cdot d\mathbf{e}_y) d\mathbf{e}_y - d^2 \mathbf{m}}{d^5} = \frac{2m}{d^3} \mathbf{e}_y \ .
$$
The combined field will cause a torque on the test needle, causing it to move in the direction of $\mathbf{B}_0 + \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{d})$. Now, suppose $\alpha$ is the angle between the combined field and the external field $\mathbf{B}_0$. We can express this angle in terms of $d$, $m$, and $B_0$ by
$$
\tan\alpha = \frac{B}{B_0} = \frac{2m}{d^3 B_0} \ .
$$
This relation provides a way to determine $B_0$, provided we already know $\alpha$, $m$, and $d$. The challenge experimentally is that the magnetic field generated by the first needle will be very small, which means the deviation angle $\alpha$ will be very tiny. This simple method, known as the *Gaussian method*, has been used to experimentally measure the magnetic field strength $B_0$ of the Earth.

---

We can use the relations found in the previous example to determine the units of the magnetic field and dipole moment, in Gaussian units. First, notice the equation $\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}_0$ implies the product $m B_0$ must have units of torque, or equivalently units of energy. Second, notice from the equation for $\tan\alpha$ that the ratio $m/B_0$ must have units of $d^3$, or volume. Combined, these together allow us to determine the units of both $m$ and $B_0$. Evidently, $B_0^2$ has units of energy per unit volume, or energy density, and $m^2$ has units of energy times volume.

Recall in Gaussian units that the squared charge has units of energy times length. This means the magnetic field must have units of charge per length squared, or equivalently units of electric field. The magnetic dipole moment must have units of charge times length, or units of electric dipole moment. Thus, the electric and magnetic fields and dipole moments have the *same* units in the Gaussian unit system. This hints at a strong relationship between electricity and magnetism, which we'll explore shortly.

In Gaussian units, the unit of magnetic field strength is called the *Gauss*, with $1 \ \text{G} = 10^{-4} \ \text{T}$, where the *Tesla* is the SI unit equivalent. To get an idea for scales, the Earth's magnetic field strength is about $0.5 \ \text{G}$. A typical refrigerator magnet has a field strength of $\sim 10 \ \text{G}$. A very large magnet, like say an MRI machine, has a field strength of $\sim 10^4 \ \text{G}$, or $\sim 1 \ \text{T}$.

## Magnetic Fields

If this were all there was to magnetism we wouldn't have much more to say about the subject. However, it turns out that ferromagnets are not the only things that generate magnetic fields. It turns out electric currents also produce magnetic fields. Before discussing how this phenomenon arises though we first need to discuss the concept of electric current. Once we've done that, we'll discuss the relation between current and magnetic fields, as well as the force law between them.

### Current

Up until now we've always assumed that charges were *static*. Now we will allow them to move around. The movement of charge is called electric *current*. We will define current as follows. Suppose we have a set of $N$ point charges $q_i$ flowing inside some volume each with velocity $\mathbf{v}_i$. Consider an infinitesimal cross section through this volume with area element $d\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{n} da$ and thickness $d\ell$.

FIGURE (show above scenario)

On average, the charges will move through the volume with an average velocity
$$
\mathbf{v} \equiv \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \mathbf{v}_i \ .
$$
Now, the average speed at which the charges traverse the cross section in the normal direction must evidently be $|\mathbf{v}| = d\ell / dt$, which means the total charge $dq$ passing normal to the cross sectional area $da$ in a given time $dt$ must be
$$
dq = d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) = da \frac{d\ell}{dt} \ \rho dt = \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} \ da \ dt \ .
$$
Dividing both sides by $dt$, we have
$$
dI \equiv \frac{dq}{dt} = \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} \ da \ .
$$
Integrating both sides across an entire surface $\mathcal{S}$, we finally have
$$
I = \int_\mathcal{S} \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
The scalar $I$ we call the total *current* passing through a surface $\mathcal{S}$. Since current is $I = dq/dt$, it evidently must carry units of charge per unit time. In Gaussian units, current is measured in units of emu per second. In SI units, current is measured in units of Coulombs per second, also called an *Ampere* or an *amp*. The two units are related by $1 \ \text{esu} / \text{sec} \approx 10^{-12} \ \text{A}$.

Current is a measure of the movement of charge. The faster a charge moves, the higher its current. The more charge is moving, the higher the current. In practice, it turns out to be much easier to measure current in the lab than it is to measure charge. Current can be easily measured in the lab using an *amp-meter*, which measures current using Ohm's Law, an important relation between voltage and current that we'll discuss in a later chapter. Measuring charge directly is much more tricky.

It's convenient and useful to define the quantity $\mathbf{J} \equiv \rho \mathbf{v}$. We call this the *current density*. The current density is the analogue of the charge density, in that its integral gives the total current. Notice that current density carries units of current per unit area. In this sense, we can also think of the current density as the *flux* of current through a given cross section of area.

Above we assumed we had a set of charges moving through a volume, but we can also imagine lower dimensional settings as well, where charges are confined to move along a surface, or along a curve. In these settings we have lower-dimensional ways to define the current density, similar to how we defined the surface and line charge densities in electrostatics.

In two dimensions, we can go through the same math as above. Suppose we have the same set of charges moving along some surface instead of inside some volume. We can then consider the flow of charges passing normal to some curve $\mathcal{C}$ inside this surface. If the charges have a surface density $\sigma$, then the total current normal to the curve is
$$
I = \int_\mathcal{C} \sigma \mathbf{v} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \ .
$$
As we did above, it's convenient to define another current density $\mathbf{K} \equiv \sigma \mathbf{v}$, called the *surface current density*. The surface current density evidently then has units of current per unit length.

In one dimension, we can do the same thing. Suppose the same set of charges are moving along some curve. In this case we can only consider charges passing through a point along the curve. If $\lambda$ is the line density along the curve, then the total current passing through a given point is just
$$
I = \lambda |\mathbf{v}| \ .
$$
In this setting it's sometimes convenient to think of current as a *vector* by defining $\mathbf{I} \equiv \lambda \mathbf{v}$.

We've thus established the following set of relations for the total current,
$$
I = |\mathbf{I}| = \int_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{K} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \int_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
The choice of integral used will depend on the dimension of the charge distribution of a given problem. See the figure below for a visual of these different types of current densities.

FIGURE (show current densities)



- In terms of charges, $\mathbf{J} = \sum_\alpha q_\alpha \mathbf{v}_\alpha \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_\alpha)$.



### Conservation of Charge

One very important fact about electromagnetism, indeed just as important as Maxwell's equations, is that charge is conserved. That is, the enclosed charge $Q_{\text{enc}}$ inside any closed surface can't spontaneously appear or disappear. It can only flow out through the surface in the form of some current $I_{\text{out}}$. 

FIGURE (show charge and current through surface)

Mathematically, conservation of charge then says that
$$
\frac{dQ_{\text{enc}}}{dt} = -I_{\text{out}} \ .
$$
However, the statement of conservation of charge is stronger than this. Not only is charged conserved *globally*. It's also conserved *locally*. That is, no matter how small a closed surface we choose, charge must be conserved in this sense. We can formulate this statement most conveniently using a *continuity equation*.

To achieve this, we'll write the enclosed charge as a volume integral over a charge density $\rho(\mathbf{x},t)$ and the outward current as a surface integral over the current density $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t)$,
$$
Q_{\text{enc}} = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x},t) \quad , \quad I_{\text{out}} = \int_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
As usual, we denote the closed surface by $\mathcal{S}$ and its enclosed volume by $\mathcal{V}$. Plugging these integrals into the conservation law above, we have
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_\mathcal{V} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x},t) = - \int_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
Now, if we assume $\mathcal{S}$ is fixed then we can pull the time derivative inside the integral on the left-hand side. Moreover, we can use the divergence on the right-hand side to express the current as a divergence. We then get
$$
\int_\mathcal{V} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \frac{\partial\rho(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t} = - \int_\mathcal{V} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) \ .
$$
Since the closed surface is arbitrary, the only way this integral can hold is if the integrands equal. That is, if
$$
\boxed{
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0
} \ .
$$
This continuity equation fully encapsulates the statement that charge is both locally and globally conserved.

In this chapter, we will focus specifically on distributions in which $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0$. That is, we focus only on distributions where the current neither converges nor diverges at any point. This is called the *steady current* condition. The study of electromagnetism in the special scenario of steady current is called *magnetostatics*, the subject of this chapter.

FIGURE (show steady current flow, perhaps contrasting with non-steady current flow)

From the continuity equation, the steady current condition evidently implies that
$$
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} = 0 \ .
$$
This implies that the charge distribution must be time-independent, with $\rho = \rho(\mathbf{x})$. This isn't to say that the charge distribution isn't moving, only that the entire distribution is moving together in unison. This is the contrast with electrostatics, where we assumed the charge distribution was completely stationary.

One immediately implication of the steady current condition is that point charges must be excluded. Indeed, the density of a moving point charge is constantly changing, since $\rho(\mathbf{x},t) = q \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{v}t)$ is necessarily time-dependent. This means when enforcing the steady current condition, we *must* only consider extended distributions of charge, so that the movement of each charge cancels out the movement of the others on average. We'll come back to moving point charges later in electrodynamics.

### Biot-Savart Law

In the 19th century, it was discovered that electric current gives rise to magnetic fields. The first discovery in this direction was by Oersted, who noticed that if he placed a compass in the vicinity of a current carrying wire that the needle no longer pointed north. He noticed that as he moved the needle around the wire, it tended to point azimuthally to the wire, suggesting that somehow the current in the wire was altering the magnetic forces acting on the needle.

A few years later, Ampere observed that if two parallel current carrying wires were placed near each other, they tended to attract or repel each other depending on whether the currents were aligned or anti-aligned. Moreover, Ampere observed that the force per unit length of wire is inversely proportional to the distance between the wires.

Not long after, Biot and Savart were able to deduce a precise empirical relation between the magnetic field and the current flowing through a wire. They found that when a current was passed through a wire, a magnetic field strength was created due to the current. Mathematically, if a current $I$ flows through a wire, the magnetic field strength per unit length $L$ of wire satisfies


$$
\frac{B}{L} = k \frac{I}{r^2}
$$

- Be more careful here. Don't forget the angle factor $\sin\alpha$ from the cross product.
- Here $k = 1/c$ in Gaussian units.
- Note the B-field for a wire *should* be proportional to $I/\varrho$.





$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{c} \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}') \times \mathbf{x}}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3}
$$

$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{c} \int d\ell' \ \frac{\mathbf{I}(\mathbf{x}') \times \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3}
$$

$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{c} \int da' \ \frac{\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}') \times \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3}
$$



### Lorentz Force Law

In the 19th century, Ampere discovered that if two parallel wires had a current pumped through each of them at the same time, the wires tended to attract or repel each other. If the two currents ran in the same direction the wires attracted each other, and if the two currents ran in the opposite direction the wires repelled each other. Moreover, he observed that this force of attraction per unit length of wire was inversely proportional to the distance between them.

Let's formulate this more precisely. Suppose the first wire has a constant current $I_1$, the second wire has a constant current $I_2$, and the two wires are parallel to each other and a distance $r$ apart. Then the force per unit length $L$ of wire is given by
$$
\frac{F}{L} = 2 k_m \frac{I_1 I_2}{r} \ .
$$
The proportionality constant $k$ depends on the system of units used. In the SI and EMU systems one takes $k_m = 1$. In the Gaussian system we take $k_m \equiv 1/c^2$, where $c$ is the *speed of light* in vacuum. We'll see how $c$ comes into all this later. For now, just think of $c$ as a characteristic velocity constant inserted to insure that electric and magnetic fields carry the same units. As usual, in the rest of this chapter we'll work explicitly in Gaussian units.


$$
\mathbf{F} = \frac{2}{c^2} \frac{I I'}{r} L \mathbf{e}_\varrho = \frac{I}{c} \frac{2I'}{c} L \mathbf{e}_\varrho = \frac{\mathbf{I}}{c} \times \mathbf{B} \\
\mathbf{I} = I \mathbf{e}_z \quad , \quad \mathbf{B} = \frac{2I'L}{c} \mathbf{e}_\varphi
$$

$$
\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c} \int d\ell' \ \frac{\mathbf{I}' \times \mathbf{x}}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} = \frac{1}{c} \int dz' \ \frac{I' \mathbf{e}_z \times \mathbf{x}}{|\mathbf{x} - z'\mathbf{e}_z|^3}
$$



$$
\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{x} \times \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B} \\
\varepsilon_{ijk} x_j F_k = \varepsilon_{\ell m n} m_m B_n \\
\varepsilon_{ijk} x_j F_k - \varepsilon_{\ell m n} m_m B_n = 0
$$




Indeed, it was discovered in the 19th century that magnetic forces were caused by *electric current*, or moving electric charge. This discovery was first observed by Oersted, who noticed that if he placed a compass in the vicinity of a current carrying wire that the needle tended to align itself in a direction perpendicular to the wire. This discovery linked electricity and magnetism together for the first time, enabling the two phenomena to be unified into one framework.

A few years later, Ampere observed that if two parallel current carrying wires were placed near each other, they tended to attract or repel each other depending on whether the currents were aligned or anti-aligned. Moreover, Ampere observed that the force per unit length of wire is inversely proportional to the distance between the wires. More formally, suppose two parallel wires each of length $L$ are placed at some distance $r$ apart. Suppose a current of $I_1$ flows through one wire, and a current of $I_2$ flows through the second wire. Then the force strength of attraction between them is given by
$$
\frac{F}{L} = 2 k_m \frac{I_1 I_2}{r} \ ,
$$
where $k_m$ is a proportionality constant known as the *magnetic constant*. Its value and form depend on the choice of units used. In the Gaussian system of units, we take $k_m \equiv 1/c^2$, where $c \approx 3 \cdot 10^{10} \ \text{cm/sec}$ is the speed of light in vacuum. The appearance of the speed of light in this constant is indeed no coincidence. We'll see where it comes from in a later chapter.


$$
I \equiv \frac{dq}{dt} = qv
$$

$$
\mathbf{J} = \rho \mathbf{v} = \frac{\partial q}{\partial t \partial a} \mathbf{n}
$$

$$
\boxed{
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0 
} \ .
$$






$$
d\mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathbf{I}}{c} \times \mathbf{B} dt
$$

$$
\mathbf{F} = q \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B}
$$

$$
\mathbf{F} = q \bigg(\mathbf{E} + \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B}\bigg)
$$

$$
\mathbf{F} = \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \bigg(\rho(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})}{c} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})\bigg)
$$

- Magnetic forces do no work, since $\mathbf{v}$ is always perpendicular to $\mathbf{B}$. Can only change direction, not kinetic energy.
