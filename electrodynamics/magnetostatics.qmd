# Magnetostatics

Now that we've spent a considerable amount of time covering the topic of electrostatics and the basic concepts of electric fields, we will now move to the topic of magnetostatics and the concepts of magnetic fields. Magnetostatics can informally be thought of as the magnetic analogue of electrostatics. Whereas in electrostatics we were interested in the behavior of *electric fields* due to static *charges*, in magnetostatics we're interested in the behavior of *magnetic fields* due to static *currents*. We will approach this new topic in much the same way we approached electrostatics, by first defining the force between two wires of steady current, and then abstracting from that the notion of the magnetic field. We will then use the properties of the magnetic field to derive the field equations of magnetostatics, and show that these can be cast in terms of a single equation for the *vector potential*, which is the magnetic analogue of the scalar potential from electrostatics.

## Ampere's Force Law



In the 18th century, it was discovered that aside from mass, every physical body has associated to it another scalar quantity called *electric charge*, which can take on any real value, positive, negative, or zero. From these facts and other experiments, Coulomb discovered that the force between two static, charged bodies satisfies the following properties:

- The force between the two charges depends linearly on the magnitude of each charge. The larger the magnitude, the stronger the force between them.
- The force obeys an inverse square law nature similar to gravity. That is, the strength of the force between the two charges varies with the inverse square of the distance between them.
- As with gravity, the force is directed along the line of force joining the two charges.
- The force is *attractive* if the two bodies have charges of *opposite* sign, and *repulsive* if the two bodies have charges of the *same* sign. If either body has zero charge there is no force between them.
