# Magnetostatics

Now that we've spent a considerable amount of time covering the topic of electrostatics and the basic concepts of electric fields, we will now move to the topic of magnetostatics and the concepts of magnetic fields. Magnetostatics can informally be thought of as the magnetic analogue of electrostatics. Whereas in electrostatics we were interested in the behavior of *electric fields* due to static *charges*, in magnetostatics we're interested in the behavior of *magnetic fields* due to static *currents*. We will approach this new topic in much the same way we approached electrostatics, by first defining the force between two wires of steady current, and then abstracting from that the notion of the magnetic field. We will then use the properties of the magnetic field to derive the field equations of magnetostatics, and show that these can be cast in terms of a single equation for the *vector potential*, which is the magnetic analogue of the scalar potential from electrostatics.

## Magnetism

Magnetism as a qualitative subject is at least as old as electricity. In the days of Ancient Greece, Thales observed that rocks of iron ore, or lodestones, tended to attract small pieces of iron. He called this force *magnetism*, named after the ancient town of Magnesia, an area where lodestone was commonly found at the time. By the 11th century, the Chinese had discovered that iron needles could be used to create compasses for navigation, suggesting that the Earth itself had a magnetic force of its own. In the 16th century, Gilbert discovered was able to magnetic forces and electric forces must be distinctly different forces, though they appeared to be related to each other in a way that remained mysterious for a few hundred more years.

Nowadays we call naturally magnetic materials like iron *ferromagnets*. The primary ferromagnets found in nature consist primarily of the elements iron, cobalt, and nickel. To really understand how ferromagnets work requires quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. We will just briefly summarize their behavior. 

When a ferromagnetic material is brought into the presence of a magnetic field at a suitable temperature, the spins of the electrons inside the material tend on average to align themselves in the direction of the magnetic field, causing the material to become ferromagnetic.

By analogy with electrostatics, we can think of a ferromagnet is a kind of dipole, with the north pole being analogous to the positive polarization direction of the dipole and the south pole being analogous to the negative polarization direction. As with charges, we say that two like poles repel each other and two opposite poles attract each other. The most important difference here though is that we cannot separate a ferromagnet into distinct poles. No matter how finely we chop it up, the magnet will *always* contain *both* a north pole and a south pole, since an electron always contains a spin. Indeed, this one difference is probably the most important in the difference in the properties of electricity and magnetism.

Just as an electric dipole has a dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$, we'll thus assign the ferromagnet a *magnetic dipole moment* $\mathbf{m}$. We will define the magnetic moment microscopically. From quantum mechanics, we know that each electron inside a material has a microscopic magnetic dipole moment $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i$ that's proportional to its *spin* vector $\mathbf{S}_i$,
$$
\boldsymbol{\mu}_i = \gamma \mathbf{S}_i \ ,
$$
where the proportionality constant $\gamma$ is the *gyromagnetic ratio* of an electron, about $-1.8 \cdot 10^7$ in Gaussian units. The fact that $\gamma$ is negative means each $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i$ will tend to *anti-align* with the spin vector, pointing in the opposite direction. To a very good approximation, we can ignore the spin contributions from the nuclei in calculating the total dipole moment and use only the electron dipole moments. By the principle of superposition, we thus *define* the magnetic dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$ of the ferromagnet as the vector sum of the dipole moments $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i$ of each electron inside the material,
$$
\mathbf{m} \equiv \sum_i \boldsymbol{\mu}_i = \gamma \sum_i \mathbf{S}_i \ .
$$
By definition, the dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$ evidently points in the same direction as the sum total of all the electron spins $\mathbf{S}_i$, but in the opposite direction due to the minus sign in $\gamma$. By convention, the direction of $\mathbf{m}$ is called the *north pole* of the magnet, and the opposite direction is called the *south pole*.

Now, we know from electrostatics that a electric dipole moment $\mathbf{p}$ produces an electric dipole field $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})$ of the form
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{3(\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - r^2 \mathbf{p}}{r^5} \ .
$$
It thus makes sense to assume that a magnetic dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$ must generate a magnetic field $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})$ in a similar way,
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{3(\mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - r^2 \mathbf{m}}{r^5} \ .
$$
The field lines for such a pure magnetic dipole must then look identical to the field lines of the pure electric dipole.

##### Example: Measuring the Earth's magnetic field

When a ferromagnet is placed in the vicinity of an external magnetic field, its internal spins will tend to align themselves in the direction of the external field. In particular, this means that the ferromagnet will experience a torque due to this external field. This torque $\mathbf{N}$ turns out to be given by the cross product of the magnetic dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$ with the external magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_0$,
$$
\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}_0 \ .
$$
Now suppose we take a small iron needle and place it on a mechanical swivel to create a magnetic compass. Due to the torque above, the needle will rotate until its north pole is anti-aligned with the external magnetic field. Provided that external field is generated by the Earth itself, this field will point toward the north pole of the Earth itself.

FIGURE (show one needle setup)

Suppose both the needle and the external field each lie in the $xy$-plane, which we could to be the surface of the earth. Suppose the needle is located at the origin, and the external field points along the positive $x$-axis, which we'll take to be north. If $\varphi$ is the counterclockwise angle between the needle and the positive $x$-axis, then we can write
$$
\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}_0 = -mB_0 \sin\varphi \mathbf{e}_z \ ,
$$
where $m = |\mathbf{m}|$ and $B_0 = |\mathbf{B}_0|$. This means the torque will evidently point along the negative $z$-axis. We can write the magnitude of the torque $|\mathbf{N}| = I \ddot\varphi$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the needle. Plugging this in and dividing through by $I$, we end up with the following equation of motion for the needle,
$$
\ddot\varphi + \frac{mB_0}{I} \sin\varphi = 0 \ .
$$
Those familiar with classical mechanics will recognize this as the equation of motion for the simple pendulum which oscillates at an angular frequency
$$
\omega \equiv \sqrt{\frac{mB_0}{I}} \ .
$$
Evidently, the needle will oscillate forever about the north pole with this frequency, just as a pendulum would. In practice this indefinite oscillation isn't noticed, since for a real compass the swivel has friction, which causes the oscillations to dampen relatively quickly, causing the needle to come to rest in the direction of the external field. In the case of navigation, this external magnetic field is created by the Earth due to the motion of molten iron inside the Earth's core.

We can actually design a simple experiment to measure the value of the Earth's magnetic field. Suppose again that magnetic field is $\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0 \mathbf{e}_x$, but instead of one needle we have two. The first needle will be the same as before, with dipole moment $\mathbf{m}$. The second needle will be a test needle. Suppose the first needle is located at the origin and already in equilibrium with the external field, so that $\mathbf{m} = m \mathbf{e}_y$. We'll place the second test needle at the point $\mathbf{d} = d \mathbf{e}_y$, with the north pole pointed in the $y$-direction.

FIGURE (show two needle setup)

Now, since the first needle is a magnetic dipole, it will generate its own magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ given approximately by
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{3(\mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x} - r^2 \mathbf{m}}{r^5} \ .
$$
By the principle of superposition, this means the external field felt by the test needle will be the *combined* field $\mathbf{B}_0 + \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})$ at the field point $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{d}$. At this point, we can simplify the field generated by the first needle as
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{d}) = \frac{3(\mathbf{m} \cdot d\mathbf{e}_y) d\mathbf{e}_y - d^2 \mathbf{m}}{d^5} = \frac{2m}{d^3} \mathbf{e}_y \ .
$$
The combined field will cause a torque on the test needle, causing it to move in the direction of $\mathbf{B}_0 + \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{d})$. Now, suppose $\alpha$ is the angle between the combined field and the external field $\mathbf{B}_0$. We can express this angle in terms of $d$, $m$, and $B_0$ by
$$
\tan\alpha = \frac{B}{B_0} = \frac{2m}{d^3 B_0} \ .
$$
This relation provides a way to determine $B_0$, provided we already know $\alpha$, $m$, and $d$. The challenge experimentally is that the magnetic field generated by the first needle will be very small, which means the deviation angle $\alpha$ will be very tiny. This simple method, known as the *Gaussian method*, has been used to experimentally measure the magnetic field strength $B_0$ of the Earth.

---

We can use the relations found in the previous example to determine the units of the magnetic field and dipole moment in Gaussian units. First, notice the equation $\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}_0$ implies the product $m B_0$ must have units of torque, or equivalently units of energy. Second, notice from the equation for $\tan\alpha$ that the ratio $m/B_0$ must have units of $d^3$, or volume. Combined, these together allow us to determine the units of both $m$ and $B_0$. Evidently, $B_0^2$ has units of energy per unit volume, or energy density, and $m^2$ has units of energy times volume.

Recall in Gaussian units that the squared charge has dimensions of energy times length. This means the magnetic field must have dimensions of charge per length squared, or equivalently dimensions of electric field. The magnetic dipole moment must have dimensions of charge times length, or dimensions of electric dipole moment. Thus, the electric and magnetic fields and dipole moments have the *same* dimensions in the Gaussian unit system. This hints at a strong relationship between electricity and magnetism, which we'll explore shortly.

In Gaussian units, the unit of magnetic field strength is called the *Gauss*, with $1 \ \text{G} = 10^{-4} \ \text{T}$, where the *Tesla* is the SI unit equivalent. To get an idea for scales, the Earth's magnetic field strength at the surface is about $0.5 \ \text{G}$. A typical refrigerator magnet has a field strength of $\sim 50 \ \text{G}$. An MRI machine might have a field strength of at least $\sim 30 \ \text{kG}$, or $\sim 3 \ \text{T}$. The strongest continuous magnet produced in a lab thus far has a field strength of $\sim 450 \ \text{kG}$, or $\sim 45 \ \text{T}$.

## Magnetic Fields

If this were all there was to magnetism we wouldn't have much more to say about the subject. However, it turns out that ferromagnets are not the only things that generate magnetic fields. It turns out electric currents also produce magnetic fields. Before discussing how this phenomenon arises though we first need to discuss the concept of electric current. Once we've done that, we'll discuss the relation between current and magnetic fields, as well as the force law between them.

### Current

Up until now we've always assumed that charges were *static*. Now we will allow them to move around. This movement of charge is called electric *current*. We define the *current* $I$ through a surface as the rate of change of charge passing through the surface,
$$
I \equiv \frac{dq}{dt} \ .
$$
By definition, current must have dimensions of charge per unit time. In Gaussian units, current is measured in units of esu per second, sometimes called the *statampere*. In SI units, current is measured in units of Coulombs per second, also called an *Ampere* or an *amp*. The two units are related by $1 \ \text{esu} / \text{sec} \approx 10^{-12} \ \text{A}$.

Current is a measure of the movement of charge. The faster a charge moves, the higher its current. The more charge is moving, the higher the current. By convention, the current is the direction in which the *positive* charge flows. Current produced by positive charge moving in one direction is equivalent to negative charge moving in the opposite direction. We know now of course that charges in a material typically move via moving electrons, which are negatively charged. This means, for instance, that if the electrons are moving in one direction through a material, then the measured current is moving in the opposite direction.

In practice, it turns out to be much easier to measure current in the lab than it is to measure charge. Current can be easily measured in the lab using an *amp-meter*, which measures current using Ohm's Law, an important relation between voltage and current that we'll discuss in a later chapter. Measuring charge itself directly is much more tricky.

We'll write the current in terms of a density as follows. Suppose we have a set of $N$ point charges $q_i$ flowing inside some volume each with velocity $\mathbf{v}_i$. Consider an infinitesimal cross section through this volume with area element $d\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{n} da$ and thickness $d\ell$.

FIGURE (show above scenario)

On average, the charges will move through the volume with an average velocity
$$
\mathbf{v} \equiv \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \mathbf{v}_i \ .
$$
Now, the average speed at which the charges traverse the cross section in the normal direction must evidently be $|\mathbf{v}| = d\ell / dt$, which means the total charge $dq$ passing normal to the cross sectional area $da$ in a given time $dt$ must be
$$
dq = d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) = da \frac{d\ell}{dt} \ \rho dt = \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} \ da \ dt \ .
$$
Dividing both sides by $dt$, we have
$$
dI \equiv \frac{dq}{dt} = \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} \ da \ .
$$
Integrating both sides across an entire surface $\mathcal{S}$, we finally have
$$
I = \int_\mathcal{S} \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
The scalar $I$ yields the total current passing through a surface $\mathcal{S}$. 

It's convenient and useful to define the quantity $\mathbf{J} \equiv \rho \mathbf{v}$. We call this the *current density*. The current density is the analogue of the charge density, in that its integral gives the total current. Notice that current density carries units of current per unit area. In this sense, we can also think of the current density as the *flux* of current through a given cross section of area.

Above we assumed we had a set of charges moving through a volume, but we can also imagine lower dimensional settings as well, where charges are confined to move along a surface, or along a curve. In these settings we have lower-dimensional ways to define the current density, similar to how we defined the surface and line charge densities in electrostatics.

In two dimensions, we can go through the same math as above. Suppose we have the same set of charges moving along some surface instead of inside some volume. We can then consider the flow of charges passing normal to some curve $\mathcal{C}$ inside this surface. If the charges have a surface density $\sigma$, then the total current normal to the curve is
$$
I = \int_\mathcal{C} \sigma \mathbf{v} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \ .
$$
As we did above, it's convenient to define another current density $\mathbf{K} \equiv \sigma \mathbf{v}$, called the *surface current density*. The surface current density evidently then has units of current per unit length.

In one dimension, we can do the same thing. Suppose the same set of charges are moving along some curve. In this case we can only consider charges passing through a point along the curve. If $\lambda$ is the line density along the curve, then the total current passing through a given point is just
$$
I = \lambda |\mathbf{v}| \ .
$$
In this setting it's sometimes convenient to think of current as a *vector* by defining $\mathbf{I} \equiv \lambda \mathbf{v}$.

We've thus established the following set of relations for the total current,
$$
I = |\mathbf{I}| = \int_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{K} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \int_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
The choice of integral used will depend on the dimension of the charge distribution of a given problem. See the figure below for a visual of these different types of current densities.

FIGURE (show current densities)



### Conservation of Charge

One very important fact about electromagnetism, indeed just as important as Maxwell's equations, is that charge is *conserved*. That is, the enclosed charge $Q_{\text{enc}}$ inside any closed surface can't spontaneously appear or disappear. It can only flow out through the surface in the form of some current $I_{\text{out}}$. 

FIGURE (show charge and current through surface)

Mathematically, conservation of charge says that
$$
\frac{dQ_{\text{enc}}}{dt} = -I_{\text{out}} \ .
$$
The minus sign is needed to express the fact that charges are flowing out of the surface, not inward.

The statement of conservation of charge is stronger than this however. Not only is charged conserved *globally*, it's also conserved *locally*. That is, no matter how small a closed surface we choose, charge must be conserved in the sense defined above. We can formulate the statement of local charge conservation most conveniently using a *continuity equation*.

To achieve this, we'll write the enclosed charge as a volume integral over a charge density $\rho(\mathbf{x},t)$ and the outward current as a surface integral over the current density $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t)$,
$$
Q_{\text{enc}} = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x},t) \quad , \quad I_{\text{out}} = \int_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
As usual, we denote the closed surface by $\mathcal{S}$ and its enclosed volume by $\mathcal{V}$. Plugging these integrals into the conservation law above, we have
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_\mathcal{V} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x},t) = - \int_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
Now, if we assume $\mathcal{S}$ is fixed then we can pull the time derivative inside the integral on the left-hand side. Moreover, we can use the divergence on the right-hand side to express the current as a divergence. We then get
$$
\int_\mathcal{V} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \frac{\partial\rho(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t} = - \int_\mathcal{V} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) \ .
$$
Since the closed surface is arbitrary, the only way this integral can hold is if the integrands equal. That is, if
$$
\boxed{
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0
} \ .
$$
This continuity equation fully encapsulates the statement that charge is both locally and globally conserved.

In this chapter, we will focus specifically on distributions in which $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0$. That is, we focus only on distributions where the current neither converges nor diverges at any point. This is called the *steady current* condition. The study of electromagnetism in the special scenario of steady current is called *magnetostatics*, the subject of this chapter.

FIGURE (show steady current flow, perhaps contrasting with non-steady current flow)

From the continuity equation, the steady current condition evidently implies that
$$
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} = 0 \ .
$$
This implies that the charge distribution must be time-independent, with $\rho = \rho(\mathbf{x})$, which also implies that $\mathbf{J} = \rho \mathbf{v}$ is also time independent, with $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})$. This isn't to say that charges isn't moving, only they're moving in such a way that the charge distribution throughout space isn't changing. The only way this can be true is if any charges leaving any given region are getting replaced by other charges moving into that region. Of course, this is an abstraction. Yet in many physical situations, for example with current moving through a wire, this is approximately the case. This situation of course contrasts with electrostatics, where the charge distribution was also time independent. In that setting, the charges were indeed assumed to be stationary.

One immediately implication of the steady current condition is that point charges must be excluded. Indeed, the density of a moving point charge is constantly changing. If a charge $q$ is moving at a velocity $\mathbf{v}$, then its source point $\mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{v} t$ becomes time dependent, which means the density $\rho(\mathbf{x},t) = q \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{v}t)$ is necessarily time-dependent. This means when enforcing the steady current condition, we *must* only consider extended distributions of charge, so that the movement of each charge cancels out the movement of the others on average. We'll come back to moving point charges later in electrodynamics.

### Biot-Savart Law

In the 19th century, it was discovered that electric current gives rise to magnetic fields. The first discovery in this direction was by Oersted, who noticed that if he placed a compass in the vicinity of a current carrying wire that the needle no longer pointed north. He noticed that as he moved the needle around the wire, it tended to point azimuthally to the wire, suggesting that somehow the current in the wire was altering the magnetic forces acting on the needle.

Not long after, Biot and Savart were able to deduce a precise empirical relation between the magnetic field and the current flowing through a wire. They found that when a current was passed through a wire, a magnetic field strength was created due to the current. Nowadays we formulate their statement in the following way. Suppose an infinitesimal length of wire $d\ell$ experiences a current $\mathbf{I}$ at the source point $\mathbf{x}'$. This will then give rise to an infinitesimal magnetic field $d\mathbf{B}$ at the field point $\mathbf{x}$ of the form
$$
d\mathbf{B} = k \mathbf{I}(\mathbf{x}') \times \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
The constant $k$ chosen depends on the choice of units. In Gaussian units we choose $k \equiv 1/c$, where $c$ is the speed of light. This strange choice of constant is needed to make sure the dimensions are consistent in the Gaussian system. Of course, one could argue that dividing by *any* characteristic velocity will work. Why exactly that velocity is the speed of light we'll see in a future chapter when we study electrodynamics. Nevertheless, it does hint at a connection between electromagnetism and optics.

To find the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})$ generated by the full wire we need only integrate both sides along the length of the wire. If the wire lies on a curve $\mathcal{C}$ in space, we have
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{c} \int_\mathcal{C} d\ell' \ \mathbf{I}(\mathbf{x}') \times \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
This empirical result is known as the *Biot-Savart Law*. As written, the Biot-Savart law shows how to find the magnetic field due to a 1-dimensional wire. We can generalize the result immediately to 2-dimensional surfaces and 3-dimensional volumes in the usual way, by replacing a line density with a surface or volume density. The magnetic field due to a surface of current $\mathcal{S}$ can be stated by replacing $\mathbf{I} d\ell'$ with $\mathbf{K} da'$ in the formula above to get
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{c} \int_\mathcal{S} da' \ \mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}') \times \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
Finally, the magnetic field due to a volume of current is given by replacing $\mathbf{I} d\ell'$ with $\mathbf{J} d^3\mathbf{x}'$ to get
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{c} \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}') \times \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3}
} \ .
$$
It's worth comparing the Biot-Savart law in this form to Coulomb's law in electrostatics. There, we had
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
Notice that up to a constant the two laws look exactly the same, except with $\rho(\mathbf{x}')$ replaced by the cross product $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}') \times$. The appearance of a cross product is perhaps the most important mathematical difference in the formulas between electrostatics and magnetostatics. An immediate implication of this is that the magnetic field *never* points in the direction of the current, but rather in a direction perpendicular to the current, given by the direction of the cross product $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}') \times (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}')$.

The appearance of the cross product also makes calculating the magnetic field from the Biot-Savart law much more cumbersome to use than Coulomb's law, which was itself already cumbersome. We'll thus quickly move to finding better ways to calculate magnetic fields. But first we'll show a relatively simple example of how to use the Biot-Savart law directly.

##### Example: Conducting loop of constant current

The canonical charge distribution in magnetostatics is the loop of constant current. Suppose a loop of radius $a$ carries a constant current $I$ in the counterclockwise direction. To achieve this, we'll suppose the loop is centered at the origin in the $xy$-plane. Our goal will be to use the Biot-Savart law to calculate the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}(z)$ along the $z$-axis.

FIGURE (loop of current)

With this setup, it's not hard to see that $\mathbf{x}' = a \mathbf{e}_\varrho$ and $\mathbf{x} = z \mathbf{e}_z$, which means
$$
\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}' = z \mathbf{e}_z - a \mathbf{e}_\varrho \ .
$$
Since the current is constant and flows counterclockwise along the loop, we have $\mathbf{I} = I \mathbf{e}_\varphi$. This means we have
$$
\mathbf{I} \times (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}') = Iz (\mathbf{e}_\varphi \times \mathbf{e}_z) - Ia (\mathbf{e}_\varphi \times \mathbf{e}_\varrho) = Iz \mathbf{e}_\varrho + Ia \mathbf{e}_z \ .
$$
Now consider an infinitesimal element $d\ell' = a d\varphi'$ of the loop. By the Biot-Savart law, we have
$$
d\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c} d\ell' \ \mathbf{I} \times \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} = a d\varphi' \ \frac{I}{c} \bigg[ \frac{z}{(a^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} \mathbf{e}_\varrho + \frac{a}{(a^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} \mathbf{e}_z \bigg] \ .
$$
Integrating along the entire loop, we thus have
$$
\mathbf{B}(z) = \frac{Ia}{c} \int_0^{2\pi} d\varphi' \ \bigg[ \frac{z}{(a^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} \mathbf{e}_\varrho + \frac{a}{(a^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} \mathbf{e}_z \bigg] \ .
$$
At this point we need to be a bit careful, since cylindrical basis vectors are functions of position. It's helpful to write $\mathbf{e}_\varphi$ in terms of the Cartesian vectors to avoid this issue,
$$
\mathbf{e}_\varphi = \cos\varphi' \mathbf{e}_x + \sin\varphi' \mathbf{e}_y \ .
$$
If we plug this into the first integral, we see it must vanish since the integrand is independent of $\varphi'$ and $\cos\phi'$ and $\sin\varphi'$ are each $2\pi$-periodic functions. The second integral is also independent of $\varphi'$. Since $\mathbf{e}_z$ is constant, we finally get
$$
\mathbf{B}(z) = \frac{2\pi Ia^2}{c(a^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} \mathbf{e}_z \ .
$$
Thus, along the $z$-axis the magnetic field points only in the $z$-direction. This should make sense by symmetry. After all, the current along the loop is constant, which means any segment of field in the $\varrho$-direction must cancel with an opposite segment of field, leaving only the $z$-component to contribute anything.

Let's now check the far field limit $z \gg a$. In this limit, $(a^2 + z^2)^{-3/2} \approx 1/z^3$, and so
$$
\mathbf{B}(z) \approx \frac{2\pi Ia^2}{cz^3} \ .
$$

Since the far field falls off like $1/r^3$, in this limit the magnetic field seems to behave like a dipole field.

---

In fact, the lowest non-vanishing moment of magnetic field will *always* be at least a dipole field, as we'll see later. There will never be a monopole field contribution. Said equivalently, there is no such thing as a magnetic monopole, as far as we can tell based on all experiments done up to this day. More advanced theories predict that they could exist, but experiments have never found them. Until found, we're left to assume based on all experimental evidence that no magnetic monopoles exist in nature.

It's tempting to ask whether we can use the Biot-Savart law to calculate the magnetic field generated by a moving point charge. If we naively attempted to apply the Biot-Savart law to a moving point charge $q$ of velocity $\mathbf{v}$, we'd find a magnetic field
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = q \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{v}t}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{v}t|^3} \ .
$$
But this can't be true, since the Biot-Savart law requires that magnetic field only be a function of position and not time. The only way the magnetic field can be time-independent is if the steady current condition is imposed, which means the Biot-Savart law implicitly assumes the steady current condition is true. We thus cannot use the Biot-Savart law on point charges, at least without there being so many of them that we can meaningfully impose the steady current condition. To deal with point charges we'll necessarily need electrodynamics, where we allow the electric and magnetic fields to both be time-dependent.

##### Example: Infinite conducting wire of constant current

Consider now an infinitely long conducting wire of constant current $I$. We'd again like to use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field created due to this current-carrying wire.

We'll assume the wire is oriented along the $z$-axis, which means $\mathbf{I} = I \mathbf{e}_z$ and $\mathbf{x}' = z' \mathbf{e}_z$. We'll find it convenient for this problem to work in cylindrical coordinates, so that $\mathbf{x} = \varrho \mathbf{e}_\varrho + z \mathbf{e}_z$. This means
$$
\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}' = \varrho \mathbf{e}_\varrho + (z-z') \mathbf{e}_z \ .
$$
The cross product of the current vector with this separation vector is thus
$$
\mathbf{I} \times (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}') = I\varrho (\mathbf{e}_z \times \mathbf{e}_\varrho) = I\varrho \mathbf{e}_\varphi \ .
$$
The line element along the wire is clearly just $d\ell' = dz'$, which means
$$
d\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c} d\ell' \ \mathbf{I} \times \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} = \frac{I\varrho}{c} \mathbf{e}_\varphi dz' \ \frac{1}{\big(\varrho^2 + (z-z')^2\big)^{3/2}}  \ .
$$
Notice that in this case we pulled $\varrho$ and $\mathbf{e}_\varphi$ out of the integral since neither depend on $z'$. We now need to integrate this along the length of the wire, which is infinite,
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{I\varrho}{c} \mathbf{e}_\varphi \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{dz'}{\big(\varrho^2 + (z-z')^2\big)^{3/2}} \ .
$$
Evaluating this integral can be done using elementary methods we've seen before in the course. In the end we simply get
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{2I}{c\varrho} \mathbf{e}_\varphi \ .
$$
Evidently, the magnetic field of an infinite wire of constant current falls off like $1/\varrho$, just like the electric field of an infinite wire of constant charge density. However, unlike the electric field, the magnetic field is directed *azimuthally* around the wire.

### Lorentz Force Law

Also in the early 19th century, Ampere observed that if two parallel current carrying wires were placed near each other, they tended to attract or repel each other depending on whether the currents were aligned or anti-aligned. More precisely, suppose the first wire carries a current $I_1$ and the second wire carries a current $I_2$. If the wires are separated by a distance $d$, Ampere found that the force per unit length $f$ is given by
$$
f = 2 k_m \frac{I_1 I_2}{d} \ .
$$
The constant of proportionality $k_m$ depends on the choice of units. In Gaussian units we choose $k_m \equiv 1/c^2$, where $c$ is again the speed of light, which means the above law becomes
$$
f = \frac{2 I_1 I_2}{c^2 d} \ .
$$
Later on in the century, Lorentz formulated a precise statement of the force on a moving point charge in a magnetic field. Suppose a point charge $q$ is moving at a velocity $\mathbf{v}$ in the presence of some external magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$. This charge will feel a force due to the field given by the *Lorentz Force Law*,
$$
\mathbf{F} = \alpha q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} \ .
$$
Here $\alpha$ is yet another proportionality constant that depends on the choice of units. In the Gaussian system we choose $\alpha = 1/c$, which again ensures $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ carry the same dimensions. In these units, we get
$$
\mathbf{F} = q \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B} \ .
$$
Evidently, the force due to a magnetic field will always be perpendicular to both the velocity of the charge as well as the magnetic field. This fact immediately implies something interesting, magnetic fields can only change the direction of a moving charge, not speed it up or slow it down. Said differently, magnetic forces do no work.

To see why this is true, consider the work done in moving a charge along some path $\mathcal{C}$ in the presence of a magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$. Plugging in the Lorentz force law and noting that $d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \mathbf{v} dt$, the work $W$ done in moving the charge along the path must be
$$
W = \int_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \int_\mathcal{C} \bigg(q \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B}\bigg) \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \frac{q}{c} \int dt \ \big(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}\big) \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 \ .
$$
Thus, magnetic forces do no work. That is, they cannot change the kinetic energy of the moving charge. They can only deflect the moving charge in another direction.

The Lorentz force law is more often stated in the more general setting where both an external electric and magnetic fields may be present. Recall from electrostatics that the force on a point charge $q$ due to an external electric field is given by $\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{E}$. By the principle of superposition then, the combined force on a moving charge will be the sum of electric and magnetic forces,
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{F} = q \bigg(\mathbf{E} + \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B}\bigg) 
} \ .
$$
Notice that we can immediately deduce something practical from this equation. For a given field strength, the magnetic force on a charged particle will typically be *much* smaller than the electric force, unless the particle is moving at velocity that's an appreciable fraction of the speed of light $c$. This means that in almost all practical applications the electric forces will dominate the magnetic forces, unless a very strong external magnetic field is applied to compensate.

The Lorentz force law can easily be stated for continuous charge distributions as well. Consider an infinitesimal unit of charge $dq = \rho d^3\mathbf{x}$. This must obey the above force law, giving rise to an infinitesimal force $d\mathbf{F}$ given by
$$
d\mathbf{F} = d^3\mathbf{x} \ \bigg(\rho\mathbf{E} + \rho \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c} \times \mathbf{B} \bigg) \ .
$$
Since $\mathbf{J} = \rho \mathbf{v}$ is the current density, when we integrate over the entire charge distribution we get
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{F} = \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \bigg(\rho(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})}{c} \times \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})\bigg)
} \ .
$$
This is the most general form of the Lorentz force law we can write down in electromagnetism. In lower dimensions the result will be similar, except with the densities and differentials replaced by their lower dimensional counterparts.

##### Example: Ampere's Current Law

We'll now derive Ampere's current law between two current carrying wires. Suppose two parallel wires are separated by some distance $d$, where the first wire carries a current $I_1$ and the second wire carries a current $I_2$. We mentioned above that the following result was found empirically,
$$
f = \frac{2I_1 I_2}{c^2 d} \ ,
$$
where $f$ is the force per unit length between the two wires. It's pretty trivial to derive this result using the Lorentz force law.

To do this it suffices to examine the force exerted by one wire on the other. We'll focus on finding the force exerted on the second wire by the first. Suppose the two wires are oriented in the $z$-direction, with the first wire exactly along the $z$-axis and the second wire translated by $d$ along the $y$-axis, as shown below.

FIGURE (show two current carrying wires)

Assuming both wires are sufficiently long that we can treat them as having infinite length. This means the first wire will produce a magnetic field of the form
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{2I_1}{c\varrho} \mathbf{e}_{\varphi} \ .
$$
To find the force the first wire exerts on the second wire we only care about field points $\mathbf{x} = z \mathbf{e}_z$ along the first wire. Along the first wire, $\varrho = d$ and $\mathbf{e}_\varphi = \mathbf{e}_x$, which means the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_1$ experienced by the second wire due to the first wire is
$$
\mathbf{B}_1 = \frac{2I_1}{cd} \mathbf{e}_x \ .
$$
By the Lorentz force law, the force on the second wire due to the first wire will be given by integrating
$$
d\mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{c} \mathbf{I}_2 \times \mathbf{B}_1 d\ell = \frac{1}{c} (I_2 \mathbf{e}_z) \times \bigg(\frac{2I_1}{cd} \mathbf{e}_x\bigg) d\ell = \frac{2I_1 I_2}{c^2 d} \mathbf{e}_y d\ell \ .
$$
Now, if we were interested in the *total* force exerted on the second wire, we'd need to integrate along the full length of the first wire, which would be infinite. But we're only interested in the force per unit length $\mathbf{f}$, which is just
$$
\mathbf{f} = \frac{d\mathbf{F}}{d\ell} = \frac{2I_1 I_2}{c^2 d} \mathbf{e}_y \ .
$$
This is exactly Ampere's current law. Notice that the force between the two wires is in the direction of separation between them. By Newton's third law, the force felt by the first wire due to the second wire must be exactly the same. This means both wires are attracted are repelled by exactly the same force. The wires will attract if the two currents are opposite and repulse otherwise. This effect can be observed in the lab, though one would need to use pretty high currents to actually observe these forces by eye. For example, to create a force of $1 \ \text{lbf} \approx 4 \cdot 10^5 \ \text{dyne}$ between two wires of length $3 \ \text{ft} \approx 10^2 \text{cm}$ separated by a distance of $6 \ \text{in} \approx 15 \ \text{cm}$, one would need to use a huge current of about $2000$ amps!

A similar result can be derived for the force between two arbitrary wires each of constant current. If the first wire has a current $\mathbf{I}_1$ along some curve $\mathcal{C}_1$ and the second wire has a current $\mathbf{I}_2$ along some curve $\mathcal{C}_2$, then the force $\mathbf{F}_{12}$ exerted on the first wire due to the second wire is given by
$$
\mathbf{F}_{12} = - \frac{1}{c^2} \int_{\mathcal{C}_1} d\ell_1 \int_{\mathcal{C}_2} d\ell_2 \ \mathbf{I}_1 \cdot \mathbf{I}_2 \frac{\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2}{|\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2|^3} \ ,
$$
where $\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2$ is the separation vector between any two source points along the two wires. This can easily be derived by using the Biot-Savart law on the second wire. By symmetry, it's clear that the force $\mathbf{F}_{21}$ on the second wire due to the first wire is equal and opposite, with $\mathbf{F}_{21} = -\mathbf{F}_{12}$.

## Field Equations

Just as it wasn't convenient or illuminating in electrostatics to use Coulomb's law to calculate and study electric fields, it's not convenient in magnetostatics to use the Biot-Savart law to calculate or study magnetic fields. We'll thus want to re-cast the Biot-Savart law as a set of field equations.

### Derivation

By the Biot-Savart law, the magnetic field created by a volume of steady current is given by
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{c} \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}') \times \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
Now, we know from electrostatics that the gradient with respect to $\mathbf{x}$ is given by
$$
\nabla \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = -\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
Indeed, we used this fact to derive the scalar potential $\phi(\mathbf{x})$. We also know from vector calculus that any curl of a scalar field $f(\mathbf{x})$ times a vector $\mathbf{v}$ can be rewritten in the form
$$
\nabla \times \big(f(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{v}\big) = -\mathbf{v} \times \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \ .
$$
If this isn't obvious, just write the left-hand side in index notation and do the algebra. Together, these imply that
$$
\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}') \times \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} = -\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}') \times \nabla \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = \nabla \times \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
Plugging this into the Biot-Savart law and pulling the curl operator outside the integral, we thus have
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = \nabla \times \frac{1}{c} \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
The argument inside the curl is evidently some vector field $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x})$ given by the integral
$$
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{1}{c} \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
We call this the *vector potential*. We'll study this in greater detail later. For now, we've established that we can write
$$
\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A} \ .
$$
By the Helmholtz theorem, we know this must be equivalent to the statement that the divergence of $\mathbf{B}$ must vanish,
$$
\boxed{
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 
} \ .
$$
Given the similarity to Gauss's law for electricity, this field equation is sometimes called Gauss's law for magnetism. Unlike in electrostatics though, the divergence of the magnetic field will *always* be zero, even in electrodynamics.

To derive the remaining field equation let's now look at the curl of the magnetic field. Recall from vector calculus that
$$
\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) = \nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} \ .
$$
Clearly the left-hand side is just $\nabla \times \mathbf{B}$, what we seek to find. Let's now simplify the right-hand side, starting with the first term. Plugging in the integral for $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x})$ and moving the divergence inside the integral, we have
$$
\nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}) = \nabla \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \nabla \cdot \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
To simplify this expression, notice first that the integrand can using the vector calculus identity
$$
\nabla \cdot \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}') \cdot \nabla \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|}
$$
Next, we'll use a useful fact that we'll see a few times in the rest of this course. Namely, the gradient of $1/|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|$ with respect to $\mathbf{x}$ is just minus its gradient with respect to $\mathbf{x}'$,
$$
\nabla \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = -\nabla' \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
If we apply this trick to the above integral and then integrate by parts to move the derivatives from $1/|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|$ to $\mathbf{J}'(\mathbf{x}')$, we get
$$
\int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \nabla \cdot \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = -\int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}') \cdot \nabla' \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\nabla' \cdot \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
Of course, for this to be true we require that the surface term vanishes as $r' \to \infty$. This will be true so long as $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')$ goes to zero at infinity faster than $1/r'^2$, which will be the case at least for all localized current distributions.

Now, in magnetostatics we require that the steady current condition hold, which means we must have $\nabla' \cdot \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}') = 0$. This means the integrand must vanish for all $\mathbf{x}'$, which means the integral also must vanish, which means $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = 0$, which means that $\nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}) = 0$ as well.

We now need to simplify $\nabla^2 \mathbf{A}$. Plugging in the integral for $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x})$ and moving $\nabla^2$ inside the integral, we have
$$
\nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{c} \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \nabla^2 \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
Since $\nabla^2 \ 1/|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'| = -4\pi \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}')$ the integral is trivial, giving $\nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = -4\pi/c \ \mathbf{J}$.

Thus, in magnetostatics, the curl of the magnetic field is evidently proportional to the current density, with
$$
\boxed{
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J}
} \ .
$$
This result is known as *Ampere's Law* in differential form. We'll study it in more detail shortly.

Summarizing what we've found, we've established the following two field equations of magnetostatics,
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \quad , \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J} \ .
$$
So what do these tell us? Let's compare these with the field equations we found for electrostatics,
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 4\pi \rho \quad , \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0 \ .
$$
In electrostatics, it appears that it's the charge distribution that gives rise to the electric field. There are no currents present. Meanwhile, in magnetostatics it appears it's the current distribution that gives rise to the magnetic field. In this case there are no charges present. In classical electromagnetism, it's only electric currents that cause magnetic fields. There is no notion of magnetic charge, or said differently there is no notion of magnetic monopoles. Again, it's possible these *may* exist, but we've never found them. Until that happens, we take these equations as reality.

### Ampere's Law

In electrostatics, we were able to use the integral form of Gauss's law to easily find the electric field of several charge distributions with high degrees of symmetry. It turns out we can do something similar with Ampere's law, but to do that we first need to convert the differential form of Ampere's law into its integral form.

To do this, we'll choose some arbitrary surface $\mathcal{S}$ and integrate both sides of Ampere's law over this surface,
$$
\int_{\mathcal{S}} (\nabla \times \mathbf{B}) \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \frac{4\pi}{c} \int_{\mathcal{S}} \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
Now, notice that the path integral on the right-hand side is just the total enclosed current $I_\text{enc}$ flowing through the closed loop,
$$
I_\text{enc} = \int_{\mathcal{S}} \mathbf{J} \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
The integral on the left-hand side can be rewritten as a surface integral using Stokes' theorem. Suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is the closed loop that bounds the surface $\mathcal{S}$ chosen above. Then by Stokes' theorem we have
$$
\int_{\mathcal{S}} (\nabla \times \mathbf{B}) \cdot d\mathbf{a}  = \oint_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \ .
$$
Putting these together, we have the integral form of Ampere's law,
$$
\boxed{
\oint_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \frac{4\pi}{c} I_\text{enc}
} \ .
$$
In words, the integral form of Ampere's law says that the total *circulation* of magnetic field through any closed loop is proportional to the enclosed current flowing through that loop.

The power of this form of Ampere's law lies in the fact that for a given current distribution, Ampere's law must be true for *any* closed loop $\mathcal{C}$ we choose. This means if we need to calculate the magnetic field of an enclosed current distribution then we can choose any closed loop we like to do so. We call any such choice of closed loop an *Amperian loop*. Indeed, this is very similar to Gauss's law, which says we're allowed to choose any closed surface, or *Gaussian surface*, we like to calculate the electric field of an enclosed charge distribution.

Suppose for a given current distribution we know that it has a certain type of symmetry that enables us to choose an Amperian loop such that the magnetic field strength along this loop is constant. If the field is constant along some section of the loop with length $L$, then we'd have
$$
\oint_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = |\mathbf{B}| \oint_{\mathcal{C}} d\ell = |\mathbf{B}| L \ .
$$
This means the magnetic field strength $|\mathbf{B}|$ along this loop is evidently just
$$
|\mathbf{B}| = \frac{4\pi}{c} \frac{I_\text{enc}}{L} \ .
$$
Of course, for this to work we need to easily be able to identify the symmetry of a given current distribution and find an Amperian loop that matches this symmetry. Just as with Gauss's law, there are only a handful of distributions in which this is really possible. Those are the infinite wire, the infinite sheet, and the solenoid. Let's look at each of these one by one.

##### Infinite conducting wire of current

Consider again the infinite conducting wire of uniform current $I$. We calculated the magnetic field of this wire before using the Biot-Savart law. Now we'll do the same using Ampere's law. We'll again suppose the wire is oriented along the $z$-axis.

FIGURE

From symmetry it's clear that the magnetic field of the wire should only be a function of the cylindrical radius $\varrho$, and the field should point in the $\varphi$-direction by the right-hand rule. We thus need only to find the field strength $B(\varrho)$, where
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = B(\varrho) \mathbf{e}_\varphi \ .
$$
Now, $B(\varrho)$ is clearly constant along any counterclockwise circular loop of radius $\varrho$ around the wire. We'll thus choose these circular loops as the Amperian loop. Inside such a loop the enclosed current is clearly just the current flowing through the wire, meaning $I_\text{enc} = I$. Since such a loop has a length $L = 2\pi \varrho$, we evidently have
$$
B(\varrho) = \frac{4\pi}{c} \frac{I_\text{enc}}{L} = \frac{4\pi}{c} \frac{I}{2\pi \varrho} \ .
$$
Thus, the magnetic field strength of the infinite wire is just
$$
B(\varrho) = \frac{2I}{c\varrho} \ ,
$$
which is the same result we found before using the Biot-Savart law directly.

##### Infinite conducting sheet of current

Consider now an infinite conducting sheet of uniform surface current density $K$. The magnetic field of this sheet can also be easily calculated using Ampere's law.

We'll suppose the sheet is oriented in the $xy$-plane, with the current flowing in the $x$-direction, so $\mathbf{K} = K \mathbf{e}_x$. From symmetry, it's clear that the magnetic field of the sheet can only be a function of $z$, and the field should point in the negative $y$-direction by the right-hand rule. We thus need only to find the field strength $B(z)$, where
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = -B(z) \mathbf{e}_y \ .
$$
It's also clear from symmetry that we must have $B(-z) = -B(z)$, meaning the field changes direction crossing the $z$-axis.

Now, $B(z)$ is clearly constant along any section of loop parallel to the $xy$-plane. We'll thus define an Amperian loop $\mathcal{C}$ as follows.

- $\mathcal{C}_1$: A directed line segment of length $L$ from $(0,-L/2,z)$ to $(0,L/2,z)$.
- $\mathcal{C}_2$: A directed line segment of length $2|z|$ from $(0,L/2,z)$ to $(0,L/2,-z)$.
- $\mathcal{C}_3$: A directed line segment of length $L$ from $(0,L/2,-z)$ to $(0,-L/2,-z)$.
- $\mathcal{C}_4$: A directed line segment of length $2|z|$ from $(0,-L/2,-z)$ to $(0,-L/2,z)$.

See the figure below for a visual of the loop along with the flow of current along the sheet.

FIGURE (show sheet of current with loop)

Then, the circulation integral over the entire loop $\mathcal{C}$ is just the circulation integral over each of the four segments,
$$
\int_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \int_{\mathcal{C}_1} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} + \int_{\mathcal{C}_2} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} + \int_{\mathcal{C}_3} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} + \int_{\mathcal{C}_4} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \ .
$$
Now, notice that the integrals over the vertical segments $\mathcal{C}_2$ and $\mathcal{C}_4$ must be equal and opposite since the field depends only on $z$ and not $x$ and $y$. This means only the horizontal segments contribute anything, giving $B(z) L$ over $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $B(-z) L$ over $\mathcal{C}_3$. Thus,
$$
\int_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = L B(z) + L B(-z) = 2L B(z) \ .
$$
The enclosed current through the loop is just the current flowing through the line segment joining $(0,-L/2,0)$ to $(0,L/2,0)$. Since this segment has length $L$ and the current density through it is a constant $K$, the enclosed current is just $I_\text{enc} = K L$. 

Putting these together, by Ampere's law we finally have
$$
B(z) = \frac{2\pi K}{c} \ .
$$
Thus, the magnetic field strength is constant at any point above or below the sheet, just as the electric field of an infinite sheet of charge is constant. Since $B(-z) = -B(z)$, the field strength experiences a discontinuity when crossing the sheet. The magnetic field strength changes discontinuously by exactly $\Delta B = 4\pi K/c$. We saw this behavior in electrostatics as well, where the electric field through an infinite sheet of charge changes by a discontinuous amount $\Delta E = 4\pi \sigma$ when crossing the sheet.

On top of this discontinuity in the field strength, the magnetic field changes direction sharply when crossing the sheet, with
$$
B(\pm z) \mathbf{e}_y = \mp \frac{2\pi K}{c} \mathbf{e}_y \ .
$$
Again, we saw this behavior with the electric field as well, which flips directions when crossing the infinite sheet of charge.

##### Solenoid

The final current distribution we'll consider is the *solenoid*. A solenoid is a tightly wound coil of conducting wire through which a current is pumped, so tightly wound that the current always points azimuthally along the coil. Provided the coil is wound tightly enough, the magnetic field inside the coil will be constant and point cylindrically outward from the coil, while outside the wire the field will vanish. 

To see why this is the case, suppose we have an infinitely long coil of wire oriented along the $z$-axis with $n$ total turns of wire per unit length, each of a constant radius $a$. Suppose we now pump a constant current $I$ through the wire in the counterclockwise direction.  Now, if we assume the current is moving azimuthally, there can be no azimuthal component to the field since the field is always perpendicular to the current. But there also can't be a radial direction to the field either. To see why, suppose we choose a field point inside the solenoid. Since reversing the direction of the current through the solenoid shouldn't alter the radial current of the field due to symmetry. This means the magnetic field of the solenoid must point in the $z$-direction,
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = B(\mathbf{x}) \mathbf{e}_z \ .
$$
Let's now look closer at the field strength $B(\mathbf{x})$. By symmetry, the field strength cannot depend on $\varphi$ or $z$ since the solenoid is cylindrically symmetric. If it depends on anything, it can thus only depend on the radial distance $\varrho$. To analyze this dependence we'll need to consider two cases, field points lying either inside or outside the radius of the solenoid.

FIGURE (solenoid with two loops, inner and outer rectangles)

To that end let's first suppose we have an Amperian loop lying completely outside the solenoid consisting of a rectangle of height $\ell$ oriented along the $z$-axis, as shown in the above figure. Since there is no enclosed current flowing through this loop, and since for each horizontal segment of loop we have $\mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = 0$, by Ampere's law we must have
$$
\int_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = B(a) \ell - B(b) \ell = 0 \ .
$$
This means $B(a) = B(b)$, which means the field strength also doesn't depend on $\varrho$, and hence must be constant. Now, outside of the solenoid we expect the field should go to zero at infinity as it would for any wire. But since the field is independent of $\varrho$, the only way this can be true is if $B = 0$ when $\varrho \geq a$.

By the same argument, the field also must be constant inside the solenoid, when $\varrho < a$, but it need not vanish. To find out what its value is inside,  we'll take the same Amperian loop defined above, but translate it inward so the inner vertical segment lies along the $z$-axis. If we now look at the circulation integral again, we find that only the inner vertical segment contributes anything to the circulation since the outer vertical segment must vanish, giving
$$
\int_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = B \ell \ .
$$
But now this new loop contains an enclosed current consisting of the product of the current $I$ with the number of coils $n \ell$ passing through the enclosed surface of the loop,
$$
I_\text{enc} = n\ell I \ .
$$
By Ampere's law, inside the wire we thus have a constant magnetic field strength of
$$
B = \frac{4\pi}{c} n I \ .
$$
In summary then, the magnetic field of an infinitely long solenoid of radius $a$ is thus
$$
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{4\pi}{c} n I \mathbf{e}_z & \varrho < a \ , \\
\mathbf{0} & \varrho \geq a \ .
\end{cases}
$$
Evidently, the solenoid is able to produce a uniform magnetic field inside an enclosed volume. In this sense, the solenoid is to magnetostatics what the parallel plate capacitor is to electrostatics, a simple device for producing a uniform field. This makes the solenoid a very useful and practical means for generating magnetic fields in the lab and in many engineering devices.

## Vector Potential

In electrostatics, we saw that we could always write the electric field as the gradient of the scalar potential. Something similar exists in magnetostatics. We cannot write the magnetic field as the gradient of a scalar potential, but we can write it as the curl of a vector potential. Indeed, the need for a vector potential leads to the many differences between electricity and magnetism.

### Definition

In the previous section, we showed that we can express the magnetic field in terms of the curl of a *vector potential*,
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}
} \ ,
$$
where the vector potential $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x})$ is given by the integral
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{c} \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|}
} \ .
$$
Notice that this is a vector integral, meaning that there will be three component integrals to calculate. Also, notice that $\mathbf{A}$ will always point in the same direction as the current density $\mathbf{J}$, not in the direction of the field itself.

Let's compare this to the equivalent statement in electrostatics. In that setting, we found we could express the electric field as the *gradient* of a scalar potential,
$$
\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi \ ,
$$
where the scalar potential $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ could be expressed via the integral
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\rho(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
Notice the similarities and differences between these two settings. In electrostatics, the *electric* field is the *gradient* of a *scalar* potential, while in magnetostatics the *magnetic* field is the *curl* of a *vector* potential. In a sense, the differences between the two are what gives rise to the differences in behavior we see between electric and magnetic fields. But on another hand the two expressions for the potentials look quite similar, except with $\rho$ replaced by $\mathbf{J}/c$. Since $\rho$ and $\mathbf{J}/c$ have the same units, this evidently means the scalar potential and the vector potential have the same units in the Gaussian system.

One useful vector potential to be aware of is that of a uniform magnetic field. If $\mathbf{B}$ is constant, a suitable vector potential is
$$
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x}) = -\frac{1}{2} \mathbf{x} \times \mathbf{B} \ .
$$
This can be relatively easily confirmed by writing out $\nabla \times \mathbf{B}$ in index notation and confirming it gives back $\mathbf{B}$.

Unlike the scalar potential in electrostatics, it's typically much less helpful to solve problems in magnetostatics by first calculating the vector potential and then using that to calculate the magnetic field. The reason for this is that the integral for $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x})$ is still a vector equation, which can often be as difficult to solve as finding $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x})$ from the Biot-Savart law directly. On top of this, the integral for the vector potential has the same limitation that the integral for the scalar potential does. It only works for *localized* distributions of current. For infinite currents, like for example the infinite wire, we have to calculate the field directly.

- Consider mentioning a way to get $\mathbf{A}$ if $\mathbf{B}$ is known, an integral or the flux relation $\int \mathbf{A} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \int \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{a}$.

##### Example: Vector potential of a rotating charged sphere

Suppose a hollow sphere of radius $R$ is rotating with some constant angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$. On the sphere is a uniform surface charge density $\sigma$. We'd like to calculate the vector potential and magnetic field of this rotating sphere.

FIGURE (rotating sphere)

To calculate the vector potential, we need to evaluate the vector integral
$$
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{c} \int da' \ \frac{\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
For this problem, it turns out to be easier to orient the axes so that $\mathbf{x}$ lies on the $z$-axis and $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ lies in the $xz$-plane. This way, the angle between $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}'$ is simply the polar coordinate $\theta'$, and so we have
$$
|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'| = \sqrt{r^2 + R^2 -2rR\cos\theta'} \ .
$$
To find the surface current density notice that each charge on the sphere is moving with a velocity
$$
\mathbf{v}' = \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{x}' = 

\\ R\omega [-\cos\psi\sin\theta'\sin\varphi' \mathbf{e}_x + \cos\psi\sin\theta'\cos\varphi' \mathbf{e}_x]
$$




we'll write $\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}') = \sigma \mathbf{v}'$, where $\mathbf{v}'$ is given



Now, since $\mathbf{x}' = R \mathbf{e}_r$, each charge on the sphere will rotate around the sphere with a velocity
$$
\mathbf{v}' = \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{x}' = R \omega (\mathbf{e}_z \times \mathbf{e}_r) \ .
$$
To simplify the cross product we'll want to express the radial unit vector $\mathbf{e}_r$ in Cartesian coordinates,
$$
\mathbf{e}_r = \sin\theta' \cos\varphi' \mathbf{e}_x + \sin\theta' \sin\varphi' \mathbf{e}_y + \cos\theta' \mathbf{e}_z \ .
$$
Plugging this into the velocity vector and simplifying the cross product, we then get
$$
\mathbf{v}' = R \omega (\sin\theta' \cos\varphi' \mathbf{e}_y - \sin\theta' \sin\varphi' \mathbf{e}_x) \ .
$$
This means there will be a surface current density $\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}')$ on the sphere of
$$
\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{x}') = \sigma \mathbf{v}' = \sigma R \omega (\sin\theta' \cos\varphi' \mathbf{e}_y - \sin\theta' \sin\varphi' \mathbf{e}_x) \ .
$$




### Gauge Transformations

In electrostatics, we saw that we could add any constant to the scalar potential and it wouldn't affect the physics, since in the end the electric field is the gradient of the scalar potential. A similar concept exists in magnetostatics, except it's more subtle. What physically matters is the magnetic field, since it's the magnetic field that gives rise to the forces. 

This means we can add anything we like to the vector potential, so long as its curl vanishes. It turns out that the most general thing we can add to the vector potential whose curl vanishes is the gradient of some scalar field $\chi(\mathbf{x})$. Suppose we transform some given vector potential $\mathbf{A}$ by
$$
\mathbf{A}' = \mathbf{A} + \nabla \chi \ .
$$
If we take the curl of $\mathbf{A}'$, we see that
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{A}' = \nabla \times \mathbf{A} + \nabla \times \nabla \chi \ .
$$
Since the curl of the gradient of a scalar field must vanish, for any choice of $\chi(\mathbf{x})$ we have
$$
\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}' \ .
$$
Thus, any transformation $\mathbf{A} \to \mathbf{A}'$ that adds the gradient of any scalar field $\chi(\mathbf{x})$ won't alter the underlying physics. We call the choice of scalar field $\chi$ a *gauge*, and the transformation $\mathbf{A} \to \mathbf{A}'$ a *gauge transformation*. This means that given any vector potential $\mathbf{A}$, we can always do a gauge transformation without altering the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$. In particular, this means any two given vector potentials may look very different, yet still be gauge equivalent. This is very different to what we saw in electrostatics, where the scalar potential could only differ by an additive constant.

All of this begs the question though of which gauge we should choose, and how we should choose it.  Typically, when we specify a gauge, we don't specify $\chi$ directly. Rather, we tend to specify the divergence of the vector potential. This is essentially equivalent to specifying the Laplacian of $\chi$ rather than specifying $\chi$ directly, since
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}' = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} + \nabla^2 \chi \ .
$$
In magnetostatics, the natural choice of gauge is to require that $\nabla^2 \chi = 0$, so that $\mathbf{A}$ be given exactly by the integral
$$
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{c} \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
We already calculated the divergence of this integral and showed that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = 0$. We call this the *Coulomb gauge*. 

The requirement $\nabla^2 \chi = 0$ in all space implies that $\chi(\mathbf{x})$ must be constant. As with electrostatics then, the vector potential in magnetostatics is essentially unique up to an additive constant, so long as there are no other boundary conditions present or currents don't run off to infinity too quickly.

At any rate, the gauge invariance of the vector potential makes it much more complicated to interpret physically. In electrostatics, we could interpret the scalar potential simply as the energy per unit charge relative to some ground point. But with the vector potential things are much more subtle. Nevertheless, the vector potential still has great theoretical importance, even if its physical interpretation is difficult.

### Poisson's Equation

In electrostatics, we saw that we could combine the two first order field equations for the electric field into a single second order field equation for the scalar potential,
$$
\begin{cases}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 4\pi\rho \ , \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{0}
\end{cases}
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad 
\nabla^2 \phi = -4\pi\rho \ .
$$
In magnetostatics, we can also combine the two first order field equations for the magnetic field into a single second order field equation for the vector potential. Starting with the two field equations for the magnetic field, we have
$$
\begin{cases}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \ , \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J} \ .
\end{cases}
$$
By writing $\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}$, we automatically get the first field equation for free. All we need to do now is plug the vector potential into Ampere's law. To do that, we'll again use the identity
$$
\nabla \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A} \ .
$$
The left-hand side is just $\nabla \times \mathbf{B}$, which by Ampere's law is $4\pi/c \ \mathbf{J}$. On the right-hand side we know $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = 0$, which means all that remains is $-\nabla^2 \mathbf{A}$. We thus end up with the equation
$$
\boxed{
\nabla^2 \mathbf{A} = -\frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J}
} \ .
$$
We've thus managed to reduce the two first order field equations for $\mathbf{B}$ into a single second order field equation for $\mathbf{A}$. Notice that this is again just Poisson's equation, except we now have one Poisson equation to solve for each vector component. For the same reason that it's not terribly helpful to solve for the vector potential directly from the integral, it's not terribly helpful either to find the vector potential directly from this Poisson equation either. Nevertheless, it'll still be theoretically useful in the subject.

## Field Energy


$$
\mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{8\pi} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ |\mathbf{B}|^2
$$

$$
u(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{8\pi} |\mathbf{B}|^2
$$



## Multipole Expansion
