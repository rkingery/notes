# Electrodynamics

Thus far we've spent a considerable amount of time studying *statics*, focusing on fields that are time-independent. We will now begin turning our attention to *dynamics*, where we allow the fields to depend explicitly on time. This leads us into the subject of *electrodynamics*, which we will study in depth for the rest of the course. To begin our study of this topic we will discuss a few important concepts that will lead us in the next chapter to Maxwell's equations, the crown jewel of electromagnetism.

- State quasistatic field equations
- Introduce the displacement current to maintain charge conservation


$$
\begin{align*}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= 4\pi \rho \ , \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \ , \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0 \ , \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} &= \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J} - \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \ . \\
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{E} &= -\nabla\phi + \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t} \ , \\
\mathbf{B} &= \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} \ .
\end{align*}
$$


$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0 \ .
