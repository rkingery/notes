# Electrostatics

As is typically custom in electromagnetism, we'll begin our study of the subject by focusing on the simple case of *electrostatics*. Electrostatics is the behavior of static distributions of charges and the forces they exert on other charged objects. Historically the subject was developed to study *macroscopic* phenomena. For this reason, certain abstractions we'll make in the subject should be viewed as idealizations that are convenient for the study of macroscopic phenomena, but fail to have any real meaning at the *microscopic* level, where quantum mechanical descriptions are needed.

## Coulomb's law

We can start the subject in fact any number of ways, for example by just stating Maxwell's equations and studying their implications. We'll instead stick to the more usual convention, where we start by assuming the force laws of classical mechanics along with some empirical facts about electric charges and the forces between them.

We'll assume that forces are *vectors*, meaning they have magnitude and direction. Being vectors, forces obey the principle of *superposition*, meaning the combined effect of two forces exerted on a body is given by their vector sum.

In the 18th century, it was discovered that aside from mass, every physical body has associated to it another scalar quantity called *electric charge*, which can take on any real value, positive, negative, or zero. From these facts and other experiments, Coulomb discovered that the force between two static, charged bodies satisfies the following properties:

- The force between the two charges depends on the magnitude of each charge. The larger the magnitude, the stronger the force between them.
- The force obeys an inverse square law nature similar to gravity. That is, the strength of the force between the two charges varies with the inverse square of the distance between them.
- As with gravity, the force is directed along the line of force joining the two charges.
- The force is *attractive* if the two bodies have charges of *opposite* sign, and *repulsive* if the two bodies have charges of the *same* sign. If either body has zero charge there is no force between them.

We can state this more mathematically via *Coulomb's Law*. Suppose one body has a charge $q_1$ and is located at a position $\mathbf{x}_1$, while a second body has a charge $q_2$ and is located at a position $\mathbf{x}_2$. Let $\mathbf{r}_{12} \equiv \mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2$ by the separation vector between the two bodies. Then the force on charge $q_1$ due to charge $q_2$ is given by
$$
\mathbf{F}_{12} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\mathbf{r}_{12}|^2} \mathbf{e}_{12} \ .
$$
Here $k_e$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the choice of units used. In this course we'll use the *Gaussian* systems of units, where $k_e \equiv 1$ and CGS units are used to measure force and distance. This means in Gaussian units Coulomb's Law can be written simply as
$$
\boxed{\mathbf{F}_{12} = \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\mathbf{r}_{12}|^2} \mathbf{e}_{12} 
} \ ,
$$
where it's assumed that forces are measured in *dynes* and distances in *centimeters*. This means that in the Gaussian system charge evidently must inherit units of $\sqrt{\text{dyne} \cdot \text{cm}^2}$. This derived unit of charge is called the *electrostatic unit* or *esu*, where $1 \ \text{esu} \approx 3.3 \cdot 10^{-10} \ \text{C}$â€‹ in SI units.

### Electric Fields

While we could proceed to study this force between charges perfectly well, it's more useful to make another abstraction, the *field abstraction*. Suppose we again have two charged bodies $q$ and $q'$ located in space at positions $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}'$ respectively. Due to Coulomb's Law, charge $q$ will feel a force $\mathbf{F}$ due to charge $q'$. If we look at the quantity $\mathbf{E} \equiv \mathbf{F}/q$ in the limit that $q$ becomes infinitesimally small, it's empirically found that this stabilizes out to a constant, well-defined value. This quantity $\mathbf{E}$ is called the *electric field* due to the presence of $q'$. It's a vector field satisfying the equation
$$
\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \ .
$$
Note that it's important that $q$ be taken to be infinitesimal for this definition to be well-defined. Such a charge is called a *test charge*. It's small enough that it doesn't alter the behavior of the electric field due to its presence. For more general charges, the electric field will depend on *all* charges present in space, including $q$, as we'll see shortly.

Notice that by definition the electric field as defined depends *only* on $q'$, not on $q$. We can think of the presence of $q'$ giving rise to an electric field that takes on a vector value at any point $\mathbf{x}$ in space. If a test charge $q$ is located at $\mathbf{x}$ it will feel a force of $\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E}$ due to the presence of this field.

Matching the expression $\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E}$ with Coulomb's Law, the electric field at $\mathbf{x}$ due to $q'$ can evidently be expressed as
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{q'}{|\boldsymbol{\xi}|^2} \mathbf{e}_\xi \ ,
$$
where we've defined $\boldsymbol{\xi} \equiv \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x'}$ to be the separation vector between the *field point* $\mathbf{x}$ and the charge *source point* $\mathbf{x}'$. We'll often find it more useful to express the electric field equivalently but slightly differently by using the fact that the separation vector can be written as $\boldsymbol{\xi} = |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'| \mathbf{e}_\xi$, so that we have
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = q' \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
Before continuing, it's worth taking the time to be careful what we mean by the notation we're using since we'll use it for the rest of this course. We will almost always assume the *source point* $\mathbf{x}'$ is the position vector of the *source charge* $q'$ giving rise to the electric field $\mathbf{E}$. We'll assume the *field point* $\mathbf{x}$ is the position vector at which the electric field takes on its given value. The separation vector $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ will always be the vector pointing from the source point $\mathbf{x}'$ to the field point $\mathbf{x}$. This is most easily shown in the figure below.

![](../../../Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20240308151912715.png){fig-align=center width=300}

Since forces obey the principle of superposition and electric field is proportional to force, the fields must evidently obey the principle of superposition as well. Suppose that instead of a single source charge $q'$ we have $N$ source charges $q_1, q_2, \cdots, q_N$ located at positions $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_N$ respectively. Then the combined electric field due to all source charges must be given by the sum of their individual electric fields,
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{E}_i(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^N q_i \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i|^3} \ .
$$
Note that in this case the idea is still the same. If we place a test charge $q$ at $\mathbf{x}$, the force it feels due to all of the *combined* source charges is $\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E}$.

Given that the electric field is mathematically a vector field, we can always visualize it as a vector-valued function of position. Each point $\mathbf{x}$ in space has associated to it an output vector $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})$. It's traditional though, and very convenient, to visualize electric fields using *field lines*. The idea is to imagine placing vector field arrows at each point in space and then connecting them together with lines running along the directions of the arrows.

As a good rule of thumb for drawing field lines, they should always *start* at positive charges and *end* at negative charges, or go to infinity. Field lines should never cross each other. The density of the field lines at a point indicates the strength of the field at that point. In this way, we could loosely speaking *define* the electric field at a point as the *flux density* of field lines, or number of field lines per unit area, passing near that point.

- Work example: finding electric field of discrete charges (cube maybe?)

### Coulomb vs Gravitational Forces

Given that Coulomb's Law looks so similar to Newton's Law of Gravitation, it's fair to ask how the forces compare to each other. Let's suppose we have two particles separated by a distance $r_{12}$ with masses $m_1, m_2$ and charges $q_1, q_2$ respectively. The two particles will feel both a graviational force $\mathbf{F}_g$ and a Coulomb force $\mathbf{F}_e$. We can get an idea of their relative strengths by looking at their ratio,
$$
\frac{|\mathbf{F}_e|}{|\mathbf{F}_g|} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}} \bigg / G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r_{12}} = \frac{k_e q_1 q_2}{G m_1 m_2} \ .
$$
To get a feel for these values let's pick a representative particle, the *electrons*. Then we'd have masses $m_1 = m_2 = m_e$ and charges $q_1 = q_2 = e$. In CGS units, these values are
$$
k_e = 1 \ , \ G \approx 6.7 \cdot 10^{-8} \ , \ m_e \approx 9 \cdot 10^{-28} \ , \ e \approx -5 \cdot 10^{-10} \ .
$$
Plugging these numbers in, we have
$$
\frac{|\mathbf{F}_e|}{|\mathbf{F}_g|} = \frac{e^2}{G m_e^2} \approx 4 \cdot 10^{42} \ .
$$
Evidently, for two electrons the Coulomb force is 42 orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational force. The difference between the two forces is so stark we can practically speaking neglect the effects of gravity when studying the interactions between electrons, or indeed any fundamental particle. Indeed, this is one reason why in quantum mechanics we rarely consider gravity. On the other hand, larger objects like people, planets, or galaxies tend to be electrically neutral or very close to it. This means in those cases gravity is all there is, and for large masses gravity can obviously be quite substantial.

### Charge Distributions

In classical electromagnetism we rarely find ourselves dealing with point charges. We're generally dealing with *macroscopic* materials containing many particles packed closely together. In such cases it's more convenient to treat those charges not as a large sum of point charges, but instead as a continuous *distribution* of charge characterized by some *charge density* $\rho$.

Suppose we have some macroscopic material sitting in space with a charge density $\rho$. That is, $\rho(\mathbf{x}')$ is a function that says how much charge per unit volume is in the region of space near a source point $\mathbf{x}'$. This density will give rise to an infinitesimal charge $dq' = \rho(\mathbf{x}') d^3 \mathbf{x}'$ at that point. By Coulomb's Law, this charge will then give rise to an infinitesimal electric field $d\mathbf{E}$ given by
$$
d\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = dq' \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} = d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
To get the electric field generated by the *entire* material, we need only use the superposition and integrate over the entire volume $\mathcal{V}$â€‹ of the material to get
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} 
}\ .
$$
This idea can be seen in the figure below. The gray blog is the macroscopic material. Inside this material is an infinitesimal charge $dq'$ located at the source point $\mathbf{x}'$ which defines an electric field. At any given field point $\mathbf{x}$ the field value due to $dq'$ is $d\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})$. The combined effect of all of these charges gives the full field.

![](../../../Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20240308151931197.png){fig-align=center width=300}

Note that since we can always just define the charge density outside the material to be zero, we don't have to integrate only over $\mathcal{V}$. We can integrate over all space, so long as we're mindful of where the charge density is non-zero.

Before working a few examples to find the electric field from various charge distributions, it's worth noting that in many cases we won't always be interested in 3-dimensional charge distributions like we've defined. Sometimes we'll be interested in lower-dimensional distributions as well. In these cases it'll be convenient to slightly modify our equation for the electric field by using different kinds of charge densities. 

We already saw one example of this, the point charge. While we derived the equation for the electric field point charge without the use of charge densities, we can express those equations naturally using charge densities as well. The density of a point is just a delta function. If we have a point charge $q'$ located at $\mathbf{x}'$, its charge distribution at an arbitrary point $\mathbf{x}''$ can be expressed as
$$
\rho(\mathbf{x}'') = q' \delta(\mathbf{x}''-\mathbf{x}') \ .
$$
Integrating the electric field over all space and using the sifting property of delta functions gives us our original equation for the electric field of a point charge,
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3 \mathbf{x}'' \ q' \delta(\mathbf{x}''-\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}''}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}''|^3} = q' \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
If we instead suppose a distribution of charge is concentrated along some curve $\mathcal{C}$ in space, it's more convenient to define a 1-dimensional charge density, or *line density*, $\lambda(\mathbf{x}')$ via the relation $dq' = \lambda(\mathbf{x}') d\ell'$, where we imagine $d\ell'$ being an infinitesimal segment along the curve of charge. Then the electric field would be
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int_\mathcal{C} d \ell' \ \lambda(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
This is an abstraction to be sure, but often a convenient one, for example if we're interested in the electric field due to a wire of charge. For wires we imagine the thickness being negligible compared to the lengths, meaning treating them as 1-dimensional curves of charge is convenient and useful.

FIGURE

Similarly, we can imagine a distribution of charge concentrated along some *surface* $\mathcal{S}$ in space. In this case, it's convenient to define a 2-dimensional charge density, or *surface density*, $\sigma(\mathbf{x}')$ via $dq' = \sigma(\mathbf{x}') da'$, where $da'$ is an infinitesimal patch of area inside the surface of charge. Then the electric field would be
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int_\mathcal{S} da' \ \sigma(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
Again, this is only an abstraction, but a convenient one. We'll often imagine sheets of charge where the length and width of the sheet are much larger than its thickness. In such cases it's convenient to treet the sheet as 2-dimensional.

## Gauss's Law

While Coulomb's Law is perhaps the most intuitive way to find the electric field, it's usually not the best way, nor is it the most illuminating. Typically in physics we find it useful to express equations for fields in terms of *field equations*, which are differential equations that can be solved to find the field of interest. Electrostatics turns out to have *two* field equations, one involving the divergence of the electric field, and one involving its curl. Here we'll derive the equation for the divergence, known as *Gauss's Law*.

The idea is to go back to thinking about the electric field in terms of field lines. Recall that we could think of the electric field as the *flux density* of electric field lines generated by the source charge distribution. This suggest it's useful to define what we mean by flux, or more correctly the flux through a surface.

 Suppose $\mathcal{S}$ is some surface of interest, closed or not. The *electrostatic flux* through $\mathcal{S}$â€‹ is defined to be
$$
\Phi_\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \int_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
Intuitively, this just says we can think of electrostatic flux as the *net* number of field lines passing through the surface area of $\mathcal{S}$â€‹. The more net field lines passing through the surface, the higher the flux. This is why we can think of the electric field as the electrostatic flux density, since it's in a sense just the flux per unit area through some given surface.

Note the use of the phrase *net* number of field lines here is important because flux is actually a *signed* quantity since each field line can pass through the surface on either side, which flips the sign of $\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}$â€‹â€‹. If a field line passes through the surface and back out the other direction, it contributes nothing to the flux.

Also note that the definition of flux as given depends entirely on which surface $\mathcal{S}$ we choose. We should expect that in general $\Phi_\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})$ will be different for different surfaces in space. However, as we'll soon see the flux is indeed unique for *closed* surfaces that enclose the same charge distribution.

What we'd like to do is find a way to relate the flux to the source charge density $\rho$ in some way, since we're in practice usually trying to find $\mathbf{E}$ given some known distribution of source charges. To do that let's start by trying to find the flux of a point charge $q$ located at the origin. For the flux surface we'll choose a sphere of radius $r$ enclosing the point charge. For a point charge centered at the origin, we must have
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = q \frac{\mathbf{x}}{|\mathbf{x}|^3} = \frac{q}{r^2} \mathbf{e}_r \ ,
$$
where we employ the usual convention that $r = |\mathbf{x}|$ is the distance to the field point. For a sphere of radius $r$ the area element is $d\mathbf{a} = r^2 d\Omega \mathbf{e}_r$. Integrating over all $\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}$ to get the flux, we then have
$$
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \int d\Omega \ r^2 \frac{q}{r^2} \mathbf{e}_r \cdot \mathbf{e}_r = 4\pi q \ .
$$
Thus, for a point charge, the flux through a sphere enclosing the charge is just $4\pi q$. This is in fact true for *any* closed surface enclosing the charge, not just a sphere. 

To see why, suppose $\mathcal{S}$ is some general closed surface, shaped like a potato let's say. Then
$$
\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = |\mathbf{E}| |\mathbf{n}| \cos\alpha da = \frac{q}{r^2} \cos\alpha da \ ,
$$
where $\alpha$ is the outward angle between $\mathbf{E}$ and the surface normal $\mathbf{n}$ at the field point $\mathbf{x}$. But, we also must have a new area element of $da = \frac{r^2}{\cos\alpha} d\Omega$ since the surface is no longer spherical. All together, this means the non-spherical behavior of the surface becomes immaterial to the flux, and we again get
$$
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \int d\Omega \ \frac{r^2}{\cos\alpha} \frac{q}{r^2} \cos\alpha = 4\pi q \ .
$$
What about if the charge is outside the closed surface though? What happens then? Intuitively we should expect the flux to be zero, since any field line flowing into the surface must also flow out at some point. Indeed this is what happens. Any flux of $\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}$ passing into the surface will have a corresponding flux $-\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}$ on the opposite side where the field line passes back out of the surface. This can most easly be shown from the figure below.

![](../../../Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20240318185941679.png){fig-align=center width=300}

Thus, the flux for a point charge through any closed surface is $4\pi q$ if the point charge is inside the surface, and zero if the point charge is outside the closed surface.

From here we can easily use the principle of superposition to find the flux of any charge distribution through a closed surface. If $Q_{\text{enc}}$ is the total charge enclosed by a closed surface $\mathcal{S}$, then we have
$$
\boxed{
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = 4\pi Q_{\text{enc}}
} \ .
$$
In this we've defined one version of Gauss's Law, the *integral form*. This says how the total flux of the electric field through a closed surface depends on the charges contained inside it.

Before using this formula to solve several important electrostatics problems let's quickly get what we originally sought in this section: a differential equation for the electric field in terms of the charge distribution. To do that we'll express the enclosed charge as a volume integral of the charge density,
$$
Q_{\text{enc}} = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \ ,
$$
where $\mathcal{V}$ is the volume enclosed by the closed surface $\mathcal{S}$. Next, we'll use the divergence theorem to rewrite the flux integral as a volume integral of the divergence of $\mathbf{E}$,
$$
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \ .
$$
Plugging these two into the integral form of Gauss's Law and moving everything to one side, we then have
$$
\int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \big[\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} - 4\pi\rho\big] = 0 \ .
$$
The only way this integral can be zero for all values is for the integrand to be be zero as well. That is, if
$$
\boxed{
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 4\pi\rho
} \ .
$$
This is the *differential form* of Gauss's Law. It gives us a differential equation to find $\mathbf{E}$ if $\rho$ is known. Of course, actually solving this equation is easier said than done. We'll come back to that later.

For now let's show how we can use the integral form of Gauss's Law to solve a few convenient problems. Gauss's Law is most useful when a problem has certain symmetries we can recognize. 



- Work the three common examples: line charge, sheet, sphere

## Electric Potential

We mentioned in the previous section that we need two differential equations to fully specify a vector field. We derived Gauss's Law, which gives us one equation in terms of the divergence. Now we need one more. From the Helmholtz theorem, we know that any vector field can be fully determined by knowing both its divergence and its curl. We should thus figure out what the curl of the electric field is, completing the picture.

There are a few ways we can proceed. One way is to just directly take the curl of the integral expression for the electric field and grind out an answer. This works fine, but we'll be slicker about it. Recall from classical mechanics that a force $\mathbf{F}$ is *conservative* if and only if its curl vanishes, $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0}$. We also know that any central force, a force that depends only on the relative distance between particles, is conservative. Since the Coulomb force is clearly a central force, this means it must automatically be conservative. In particular, this means we automatically must have that the curl of the electric field vanishes in electrostatics,
$$
\boxed{
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{0}
} \ .
$$
This completes our picture of field equations we need to fully determine the electric field in electrostatics. All that remains at this point is analyzing the equations to see what they're telling us.

Let's look at this curl equation and see what it implies. We know from vector calculus that any vector field whose curl vanishes must have a scalar potential whose gradient fully determines the vector field. The potential for the electric field is called the *electrostatic potential* $\phi(\mathbf{x})$, with
$$
\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi \ .
$$
Since the force exerted by the field on a point charge $q$ is given by $\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative, we know that it has a potential energy $U(\mathbf{x})$ that must evidently be proportional to $\phi(\mathbf{x})$,
$$
U(\mathbf{x}) = q\phi(\mathbf{x}) \ .
$$
This means we can interpret the elecrostatic potential as the potential energy per unit charge exerted on a test particle placed in the electric field. The units for the potential are evidently then energy per unit charge. In SI units this means the potential has units of Joules per Coulomb, which is called the *Volt*. In Gaussian units the potential has units of ergs per ESU, sometimes called the *stat-volt*, with $1 \ \frac{\text{erg}}{\text{esu}} \approx 300 \ \text{V}$.

Using the electrostatic potential we can in fact combine the two field equations for the electric field into one field equation for the potential. Since the existence of the potential already satisfies the curl constraint, we just need to plug it into Gauss's Law to satisfy the divergence constraint. Using $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi$, we have
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \nabla \cdot (-\nabla \phi) = 4\pi\rho \ .
$$
Recognizing that this is just the Laplacian for the potential, we thus have
$$
\boxed{
\nabla^2 \phi = -4\pi\rho
} \ .
$$
This is called *Poisson's Equation*. It gives us a second order PDE we can use to find the potential if the source charge distribution is known. Once we have the potential, we can recover the electric field by taking the gradient of the potential. The tradeoff, however, is that we're now dealing with a *second-order* PDEs, whereas before we had two *first-order* PDEs for the electric field. This is a good tradeoff though as we'll see later. In fact, Poisson's equation could easily be called the most important equation in electrostatics.

Perhaps the most important reason the potential is nice is that instead of solving for 3 equations, the 3 components of the electric field, with the potential we only need solve a single equation. In this sense, the electric field is evidently redundant, since each of its components are obtained from the same scalar field.

If we like, we can also invert the equation $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi$ to get an equation for $\phi$ in terms of $\mathbf{E}$,
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = -\int_{\mathbf{x}_g}^{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}') \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell}' \ ,
$$
where $\mathbf{x}_g$ is some chosen *ground point* where we've defined $\phi(\mathbf{x}_g) \equiv 0$. This can be any point we like, but for our purposes it'll usually be most convenient to choose the ground point at infinity. 

Note that in more practical applications the ground point is often chosen differently. For example, when dealing with *electric circuits* the ground point is usually taken to be the negative terminal point. Such a *potential difference* is often called a *voltage* in electronics. Voltages are frequently among the most important electricity-related quantities measured in the lab, along with *currents*, which we'll get to later.

Since the electric field is the gradient of the potential, and gradients always point normal to their contour surfaces, the potential must evidently be contour surfaces for the electric field. These surface of constant potential are called *equipotentials*. They'll always be surfaces perpendicular to the electric field lines. For example, for a point charge the equipotentials would be spheres of constant radius centered at the charge.
