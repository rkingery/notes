# Electrostatics

As is typically custom in electromagnetism, we'll begin our study of the subject by focusing on the simple case of *electrostatics*. Electrostatics is the behavior of static distributions of charges and the forces they exert on other charged objects. Historically the subject was developed to study *macroscopic* phenomena. For this reason, certain abstractions we'll make in the subject should be viewed as idealizations that are convenient for the study of macroscopic phenomena, but fail to have any real meaning at the *microscopic* level, where quantum mechanical descriptions are needed.

## Coulomb's law

We can start the subject in fact any number of ways, for example by just stating Maxwell's equations and studying their implications. We'll instead stick to the more usual convention, where we start by assuming the force laws of classical mechanics along with some empirical facts about electric charges and the forces between them.

We'll assume that forces are *vectors*, meaning they have magnitude and direction. Being vectors, forces obey the principle of *superposition*, meaning the combined effect of two forces exerted on a body is given by their vector sum.

In the 18th century, it was discovered that aside from mass, every physical body has associated to it another scalar quantity called *electric charge*, which can take on any real value, positive, negative, or zero. From these facts and other experiments, Coulomb discovered that the force between two static, charged bodies satisfies the following properties:

- The force between the two charges depends on the magnitude of each charge. The larger the magnitude, the stronger the force between them.
- The force obeys an inverse square law nature similar to gravity. That is, the strength of the force between the two charges varies with the inverse square of the distance between them.
- As with gravity, the force is directed along the line of force joining the two charges.
- The force is *attractive* if the two bodies have charges of *opposite* sign, and *repulsive* if the two bodies have charges of the *same* sign. If either body has zero charge there is no force between them.

We can state this more mathematically via *Coulomb's Law*. Suppose one body has a charge $q_1$ and is located at a position $\mathbf{x}_1$, while a second body has a charge $q_2$ and is located at a position $\mathbf{x}_2$. Let $\mathbf{r}_{12} \equiv \mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2$ by the separation vector between the two bodies. Then the force on charge $q_1$ due to charge $q_2$ is given by
$$
\mathbf{F}_{12} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\mathbf{r}_{12}|^2} \mathbf{e}_{12} \ .
$$
Here $k_e$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the choice of units used. In this course we'll use the *Gaussian* systems of units, where $k_e \equiv 1$ and CGS units are used to measure force and distance. This means in Gaussian units Coulomb's Law can be written simply as
$$
\boxed{\mathbf{F}_{12} = \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\mathbf{r}_{12}|^2} \mathbf{e}_{12} 
} \ ,
$$
where it's assumed that forces are measured in *dynes* and distances in *centimeters*. This means that in the Gaussian system charge evidently must inherit units of $\sqrt{\text{dyne} \cdot \text{cm}^2}$. This derived unit of charge is called the *electrostatic unit* or *esu*, where $1 \ \text{esu} \approx 3.3 \cdot 10^{-10} \ \text{C}$â€‹ in SI units.

### Electric Fields

While we could proceed to study this force between charges perfectly well, it's more useful to make another abstraction, the *field abstraction*. Suppose we again have two charged bodies $q$ and $q'$ located in space at positions $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{x}'$ respectively. Due to Coulomb's Law, charge $q$ will feel a force $\mathbf{F}$ due to charge $q'$. If we look at the quantity $\mathbf{E} \equiv \mathbf{F}/q$ in the limit that $q$ becomes infinitesimally small, it's empirically found that this stabilizes out to a constant, well-defined value. This quantity $\mathbf{E}$ is called the *electric field* due to the presence of $q'$. It's evidently a vector field satisfying
$$
\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \ .
$$
Note that it's important that $q$ be taken to be infinitesimal for this definition to be well-defined. Such a charge is called a *test charge*. It's small enough that it doesn't alter the behavior of the electric field due to its presence. For more general charges, the electric field will depend on *all* charges present in space, including $q$, as we'll see shortly.

Notice that by definition the electric field as defined depends *only* on $q'$, not on $q$. We can think of the presence of $q'$ giving rise to an electric field that takes on a vector value at any point $\mathbf{x}$ in space. If a test charge $q$ is located at $\mathbf{x}$ it will feel a force of $\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E}$ due to the presence of this field.

Matching the expression $\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E}$ with Coulomb's Law, the electric field at $\mathbf{x}$ due to $q'$ can evidently be expressed as
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{q'}{|\boldsymbol{\xi}|^2} \mathbf{e}_\xi \ ,
$$
where we've defined $\boldsymbol{\xi} \equiv \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x'}$ to be the separation vector between the *field point* $\mathbf{x}$ and the charge *source point* $\mathbf{x}'$. We'll often find it more useful to express the electric field equivalently but slightly differently by using the fact that the separation vector can be written as $\boldsymbol{\xi} = |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'| \mathbf{e}_\xi$, so that we have
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = q' \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
Before continuing, it's worth taking the time to be careful what we mean by the notation we're using since we'll use it for the rest of this course. We will almost always assume the *source point* $\mathbf{x}'$ is the position vector of the *source charge* $q'$ giving rise to the electric field $\mathbf{E}$. We'll assume the *field point* $\mathbf{x}$ is the position vector at which the electric field takes on its given value. The separation vector $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ will always be the vector pointing from the source point $\mathbf{x}'$ to the field point $\mathbf{x}$. This is most easily shown in the figure below.

![](../../../Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20240308151912715.png){fig-align=center width=300}

Since forces obey the principle of superposition and electric field is proportional to force, the fields must evidently obey the principle of superposition as well. Suppose that instead of a single source charge $q'$ we have $N$ source charges $q_1, q_2, \cdots, q_N$ located at positions $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_N$ respectively. Then the combined electric field due to all source charges must be given by the sum of their individual electric fields,
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{E}_i(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^N q_i \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i|^3} \ .
$$
Note that in this case the idea is still the same. If we place a test charge $q$ at $\mathbf{x}$, the force it feels due to all of the *combined* source charges is $\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E}$.

Given that the electric field is mathematically a vector field, we can always visualize it as a vector-valued function of position. Each point $\mathbf{x}$ in space has associated to it an output vector $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})$. It's traditional though, and very convenient, to visualize electric fields using *field lines*. The idea is to imagine placing vector field arrows at each point in space and then connecting them together with lines running along the directions of the arrows.

As a good rule of thumb for drawing field lines, they should always *start* at positive charges and *end* at negative charges, or go to infinity. Field lines should never cross each other. The density of the field lines at a point indicates the strength of the field at that point. In this way, we could loosely speaking *define* the electric field at a point as the *flux density* of field lines, or number of field lines per unit area, passing near that point.

- Work example: finding electric field of discrete charges (cube maybe?)

### Coulomb vs Gravitational Forces

Given that Coulomb's Law looks so similar to Newton's Law of Gravitation, it's fair to ask how the forces compare to each other. Let's suppose we have two particles separated by a distance $r_{12}$ with masses $m_1, m_2$ and charges $q_1, q_2$ respectively. Those two particles will feel both a graviational force $\mathbf{F}_g$ and a Coulomb force $\mathbf{F}_e$. We can look at their relative interaction strengths by taking their ratio,
$$
\frac{|\mathbf{F}_e|}{|\mathbf{F}_g|} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}} \bigg / G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r_{12}} = \frac{k_e q_1 q_2}{G m_1 m_2} \ .
$$
We can get a feel for this ratio by picking a representative particle. Let's suppose both particles are *electrons* with masses $m_1 = m_2 = m_e$ and charges $q_1 = q_2 = e$. In CGS units, we have
$$
k_e = 1 \ , \ G \approx 6.7 \cdot 10^{-8} \ , \ m_e \approx 9 \cdot 10^{-28} \ , \ e \approx -5 \cdot 10^{-10} \ .
$$
Plugging these numbers in, we have
$$
\frac{|\mathbf{F}_e|}{|\mathbf{F}_g|} = \frac{e^2}{G m_e^2} \approx 10^{42} \ .
$$
Evidently, for electrons the Coulomb force is 42 orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational force. This is so stark that we can for all practical purposes neglect the effects of gravity when studying the interactions between electrons. Indeed, this is one reason why in quantum mechanics we rarely consider gravity. On the other hand, larger objects like people, planets, or galaxies tend to be electrically neutral or close to it. This means in those cases gravity is all there is, and for large masses gravity can be quite substantial.

### Charge Distributions

In classical electromagnetism we rarely find ourselves dealing with point charges. We're generally dealing with *macroscopic* materials containing many particles packed closely together. In such cases it's more convenient to treat those charges not as a large sum of point charges, but instead as a continuous *distribution* of charge characterized by some *charge density* $\rho$.

Suppose we have some macroscopic material sitting in space with a charge density $\rho$. That is, $\rho(\mathbf{x}')$ is a function that says how much charge per unit volume is in the region of space near a source point $\mathbf{x}'$. This density will give rise to an infinitesimal charge $dq' = \rho(\mathbf{x}') d^3 \mathbf{x}'$ at that point. By Coulomb's Law, this charge will then give rise to an infinitesimal electric field $d\mathbf{E}$ given by
$$
d\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = dq' \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} = d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
To get the electric field generated by the *entire* material, we need only use the superposition and integrate over the entire volume $\mathcal{V}$â€‹ of the material to get
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} 
}\ .
$$
This idea can be seen in the figure below. The gray blog is the macroscopic material. Inside this material is an infinitesimal charge $dq'$ located at the source point $\mathbf{x}'$ which defines an electric field. At any given field point $\mathbf{x}$ the field value due to $dq'$ is $d\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})$. The combined effect of all of these charges gives the full field.

This gives a more useful definition of the electric field than the previous definition in terms of point charges. Indeed, we can completely recover the point charge definition from this one. The charge distribution of a point charge $q'$â€‹ located at $\mathbf{x}'$ is just proportional to a delta function, with
$$
\rho(\mathbf{x}'') = q' \delta(\mathbf{x}''-\mathbf{x}') \ .
$$
Integrating the electric field over all space and using the sifting property of delta functions gives us our original definition for the electric field of a point charge. However, the fact that the density of a point charge is an infinite point spike will create occasional paradoxes that we'll need to address later on.
