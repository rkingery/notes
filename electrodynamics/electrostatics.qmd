# Electrostatics

As is custom in electromagnetism, we'll begin our study of the subject by focusing on the simple case of *electrostatics*. Electrostatics is the behavior of static distributions of charges and the forces they exert on other charged objects. Historically the subject was developed to study *macroscopic* phenomena. For this reason, certain abstractions we'll make in the subject should be viewed as idealizations that are convenient for the study of macroscopic phenomena, but fail to have any real meaning at the *microscopic* level, where quantum mechanical descriptions are needed.

## Electric Field

We can start the subject in any number of ways, for example by just stating Maxwell's equations and studying their implications. We'll instead stick to the more usual convention, where we start by assuming the force laws of classical mechanics along with some empirical facts about electric charges and the forces between them.

We'll assume that forces are *vectors*, meaning they have magnitude and direction. Being vectors, forces obey the principle of *superposition*, meaning the combined effect of two forces exerted on a body is given by their vector sum.

In the 18th century, it was discovered that aside from mass, every physical body has associated to it another scalar quantity called *electric charge*, which can take on any real value, positive, negative, or zero. From these facts and other experiments, Coulomb discovered that the force between two static, charged bodies satisfies the following properties:

- The force between the two charges depends linearly on the magnitude of each charge. The larger the magnitude, the stronger the force between them.
- The force obeys an inverse square law nature similar to gravity. That is, the strength of the force between the two charges varies with the inverse square of the distance between them.
- As with gravity, the force is directed along the line of force joining the two charges.
- The force is *attractive* if the two bodies have charges of *opposite* sign, and *repulsive* if the two bodies have charges of the *same* sign. If either body has zero charge there is no force between them.

### Coulomb's law

Putting all of these properties together we get *Coulomb's law*. Suppose we have two point particles with charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ located at positions $\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$ respectively. Then according to Coulomb's law, the force charge $q_1$ experiences due to charge $q_2$ is given by
$$
\mathbf{F}_{12} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2|^2} \mathbf{e}_{12} \ .
$$
Here $\mathbf{e}_{12}$ is the unit vector pointing from $q_2$ to $q_1$. By Newton's third law, the force $q_2$ experiences due to $q_1$ is equal and opposite, with $\mathbf{F}_{21} = -\mathbf{F}_{12}$. Since this force depends only on the distance between the two point charges it's a *central force*, which implies that energy is conserved in electrostatics. We'll say more about elecrostatic energy later.

The proportionality constant $k_e$ has value and dimensions that depend on the choice of units used. In this course we'll mostly use the *Gaussian* system of units, where $k_e \equiv 1$ and the mechanical units are measured in CGS units. This means force is measured in *dynes* and distance in *centimeters*. Evidently then, in the Gaussian system of units charge must have units of $\sqrt{\text{dyne} \cdot \text{cm}^2}$. We give this unit of charge a name, called the *electrostatic unit* or *esu*, where $1 \ \text{esu} \approx 3.3 \cdot 10^{-10} \ \text{C}$ in SI units. In Gaussian units, Coulomb's law thus simplifies to
$$
\mathbf{F}_{12} = \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2|^2} \mathbf{e}_{12} \ .
$$
Note that as defined Coulomb's law really only holds for *point charges*. That is, for point particles where all charge is localized at a single point. This is of course an abstraction. In reality we deal with larger bodies where the charge may be distributed across the body in some way. We'll see how to modify Coulomb's law the work with more arbitrary distributions of charge below.

### What is Charge Really?

Before moving on, it's worth stopping to ask what exactly it is we mean when we say a body has charge. Mathematically, we can think of charge similar to how we think of mass. It's a scalar quantity associated with a body, except unlike mass it can take on any real value, positive or negative. More fundamentally though, the charge of a body is really an aggregate of charge due to more fundamental particles inside the body like electrons and protons. 

A body is really a collection of atoms held together in some way, each with some number of protons and electrons. The protons are held together inside nuclei that generally stay fixed unless the body is deformed, while the electrons move around according to the rules of quantum mechanics. What we think of as charge is really how the electrons and protons are distributed inside the body. If the number of electrons and protons are equal, we say that the body is charge neutral. If there are more electrons than protons the body has negative charge. If there are fewer electrons than protons the body has positive charge. 

In practice, it's the movement of electrons that control how a body is charged. In some bodies, called *conductors* these electrons move freely around the body, while for other bodies, called *dielectrics* or *insulators*, these electrons stay locked into their respective atoms and only move small amounts. In either case, if the body is charged it implies some deficit or surplus of electrons.

One would think that we should think of charge in terms of electrons and define charge in units of the number of surplus electrons present in the body. However, this wasn't known at the time the theory of electromagnetism was first formulated. It was only known that there was a scalar quantity called charge associated to the body, with no understanding of what gives rise to it. It's for these largely historical reasons that we continue to think of positive charge as moving around inside a body, even though it's really negatively charged electrons that move around.

### Coulomb vs Gravity

Given that Coulomb's law looks so similar to Newton's law of gravitation, it's fair to ask how the forces compare to each other. Let's suppose we have two particles separated by a distance $r$ with masses $m_1, m_2$ and charges $q_1, q_2$ respectively. Since the particles have both mass and charge they'll feel both a gravitational force $\mathbf{F}_g$ and a Coulomb force $\mathbf{F}_e$. We can get an idea of the relative strengths of these two forces by looking at their ratio. In Gaussian units, this is given by
$$
\frac{|\mathbf{F}_e|}{|\mathbf{F}_g|} = \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} \bigg / G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r} = \frac{q_1 q_2}{G m_1 m_2} \ .
$$
To get a feel for these values let's pick a representative particle, the *electrons*. Then we'd have masses $m_1 = m_2 = m_e$ and charges $q_1 = q_2 = e$. In Gaussian units, these values are
$$
\ G \approx 6.7 \cdot 10^{-8} \ , \ m_e \approx 9 \cdot 10^{-28} \ , \ e \approx -5 \cdot 10^{-10} \ .
$$
Plugging these numbers in, we get
$$
\frac{|\mathbf{F}_e|}{|\mathbf{F}_g|} = \frac{e^2}{G m_e^2} \approx 4 \cdot 10^{42} \ .
$$
That is, for two electrons the Coulomb force is 42 orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational force. The difference between the two forces is so stark we can practically speaking neglect the effects of gravity when studying the interactions between electrons, or indeed any small particles. Indeed, this is one reason why in quantum mechanics we rarely consider gravity. On the other hand, larger objects like people, planets, or galaxies tend to be electrically neutral or very close to it. This means in those cases gravity is all there is, and for large masses gravity can obviously be quite substantial.

### Electric Fields

While we could proceed to study this force between charges just as we did in with gravity in classical mechanics, we'll find it's useful in electromagnetism to make a further abstraction, the *field abstraction*. The reason for this is that we want to think of all interactions as *local*. That is, a particle should only feel the presence of things near by, not things far away. If we think in terms of forces we have to give locality up, since two charges will feel a force no matter how far away they are, so-called "action at a distance".

Instead what we'll do is imagine that particles interact due to the presence of background fields, and think of these fields as giving rise to forces. Suppose we have a charge $q'$ sitting in space at some position $\mathbf{x}'$. Suppose we place an infinitesimal *test charge* $q$ at position $\mathbf{x}$. By Coulomb's law, the test charge will feel a force $\mathbf{F}$ due to $q'$. We'll define a vector-valued function of position known as the *electric field* by the ratio
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{\mathbf{F}}{q} \ .
$$
Empirically this ratio is found to be well-defined and independent of the value of $q$ so long as $q$ is infinitesimal, with
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{q'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^2} \mathbf{e}_\xi \ .
$$
Here for convenience we define the separation vector $\boldsymbol{\xi} \equiv \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'$, so that the field always points from the location $\mathbf{x}'$ of the *source charge* $q'$ to the *field point* $\mathbf{x}$ where we imagine placing the test charge $q$. The relationship between all these points is shown in the figure below.

![](./resources/image-20240308151912715.png){fig-align=center width=300}

Notice that the electric field doesn't depend on $q$ at all. It has a value at every point in space. When a test charge $q$ is brought in and placed at a position $\mathbf{x}$ it feels a force
$$
\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \ .
$$
Note that the requirement that $q$ be infinitesimal in this definition is important. If it's not its presence will distort the value of the background field, in effect making *both* charges source charges for the field.

Since $\mathbf{E}$ is just a vector field we can visualize it as such. At each field point $\mathbf{x}$ in space, we can imagine plotting $\mathbf{E}$ as a vector located at $\mathbf{x}$ and pointing outward. It's traditional though, and very convenient, to visualize electric fields using *field lines*. The idea is to imagine placing vector field arrows at each point in space and then connecting them together with lines running along the directions of the arrows. Both of these visualizations are shown in the figure below for a single *positive* point source charge $q'$.

![](./resources/image-20240602115754745.png){fig-align=center width=400}

As a good rule of thumb for drawing field lines, they should always *start* at positive charges and *end* at negative charges, or go to infinity. Field lines should never cross each other. The density of the field lines at a point indicates the strength of the field at that point. In this way, we could loosely speaking *define* the electric field at a point as the *flux density* of field lines, or number of field lines per unit area, passing near that point.

We'll often find it more useful to express the electric field formula in a slightly different way by getting rid of the unit vector. Using the fact that the separation vector can be written $\boldsymbol{\xi} = |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'| \mathbf{e}_\xi$ we can write the same electric field in the equivalent form
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = q' \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
This only defines the electric field due to a single point charge $q'$. What if instead we have multiple source charges spread out in space. Suppose we instead have $N$ point source charges $q_1, q_2, \cdots, q_N$ located at positions $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_N$ respectively. Since forces obey the principle of superposition, we know we can add the force due to each source charge to get the total force,
$$
\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{F}_2 + \cdots + \mathbf{F}_N \ .
$$
Since the electric field is proportional to the force it must evidently obey the superposition principle as well. Then the combined electric field due to the presence of all of these charges must be given by the sum of each individual field,
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{E}_i(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^N q_i \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i|^3} \ .
$$
Again, the combined electric field does not depend on the test charge, only the source charges. If we imagine placing an infinitesimal test charge $q$ at $\mathbf{x}$ it will still feel the combined force $\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{E}$.

#### Example: The Electric Dipole

Let's try to find the electric field of perhaps the simplest non-trivial example, the *electric dipole*. Suppose we have two like charges of opposite sign separated by a fixed distance along some axis. More formally, suppose we have a positive charge $+q$ located at a point $\mathbf{x}_+ = \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z$, and a negative charge $-q$ located at the opposite point $\mathbf{x}_- = -\frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z$. Our goal will be to find the electric field for any field point $\mathbf{x}$ in the $xy$-plane. 

FIGURE

By the superposition principle, the electric field is given by
$$
\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_+ + \mathbf{E}_- = q\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_+}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_+|^3} - q\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_-}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_-|^3} \ .
$$
To proceed further we first need to find the separation vectors for each charge. We have 
$$
\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_\pm = r \mathbf{e}_r \mp \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z \ ,
$$
Plugging this in and simplifying, we get
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{E} &= q \frac{r \mathbf{e}_r - \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z}{|r \mathbf{e}_r - \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z|^3} - q \frac{r \mathbf{e}_r + \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z}{|r \mathbf{e}_r + \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z|^3} \\
&= q \frac{r \mathbf{e}_r - \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z}{\bigg[r^2 + \big(\frac{d}{2}\big)^2\bigg]^{3/2}} - q \frac{r \mathbf{e}_r + \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z}{\bigg[r^2 + \big(-\frac{d}{2}\big)^2\bigg]^{3/2}} \\
&= \frac{-qd}{\bigg[r^2 + \big(\frac{d}{2}\big)^2\bigg]^{3/2}} \mathbf{e}_z \ .
\end{align*}
$$
We can immediately see that the electric field for any point in the $xy$-plane must point along the negative $z$-axis. This can be understood intuitively just by vector subtracting the separation vectors in the figure above and noting that the magnitude of the field for each charge must be the same by symmetry.

This is as far as we can go as is, but we can make one useful simplification. Let's suppose $r \gg d$. This is the *far field limit* where the field point is far away from both charges. In this limit we can ignore the $\frac{d}{2}$ term in the denominator and write
$$
\mathbf{E} \approx -\frac{qd}{r^3} \mathbf{e}_z \ .
$$
This result tells us something interesting. Even far away from the source charges, the dipole doesn't seem to follow Coulomb's law since the field doesn't fall off as $\mathbf{E} \sim \frac{1}{r^2}$, but rather as $\mathbf{E} \sim \frac{1}{r^3}$. The reason for this is the two charges screen each other, canceling out the monopole field that would usually give rise to a $\frac{1}{r^2}$ term in the field. This causes the field to be weaker than we'd expect for a point charge in the far field limit.

The term $qd \mathbf{e}_z$ has a name. It's called the *dipole moment*, denoted by the vector $\mathbf{p}$. The dipole moment is a vector of magnitude $qd$ that points from the negative to the positive charge in a dipole. Using the dipole moment it's possible to show that for a general field point, not just in the $xy$-plane, we can express the electric field of a dipole in the far field limit as
$$
\mathbf{E} = \frac{3(\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r) \mathbf{e}_r}{r^3} - \frac{\mathbf{p}}{r^3} \ .
$$
Notice the first term is just the projection of the dipole onto the field point direction, which is zero when the two vectors are perpendicular. The dipole turns out to be very important to the theory of electrostatics. We'll talk about it in more detail in the next chapter when we discuss the multipole expansion.

### Continuous Charge Distributions

In classical electromagnetism we rarely find ourselves dealing with point charges. We're generally dealing with *macroscopic* bodies containing many charged particles packed densely together. In such cases it's more convenient to treat those charges not as a sum over all the point charges, but instead as a continuous *charge distribution*.

A charge distribution can be thought of as a large number of charged point particles packed densely together. Provided the charges are dense enough that we can treat them as continuous, we can define a *charge density* $\rho(\mathbf{x}')$ by
$$
dq = d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \ .
$$
Each $dq$ will give rise to an infinitesimal electric field $d\mathbf{E}$ defined by Coulomb's law. Using the principle of superposition, we can then integrate over all these charges over all space to get the electric field of the distribution,
$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} 
}\ .
$$
Strictly speaking we should only integrate over the volume $\mathcal{V}$ of the distribution, but since we can freely define the density to be zero outside the distribution we'll usually omit this from the formula and assume we're integrating over all space.

This idea can be seen in the figure below. Here the gray blob is some charge distribution, and $dq$ some infinitesimal element of it. Adding up, or integrating, over all these charges will give the full electric field $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})$.

![](./resources/image-20240308151931197.png){fig-align=center width=300}

We'll often be interested in charge distributions of lower dimension as well, for example lines of charge and sheets of charge. For this reason it's useful to define charge densities in these dimensions as well. The simplest case is the point charge, which we can think of as a zero-dimensional density. If $q'$ is some point charge located at $\mathbf{x}'$, we can use the delta function to write
$$
dq = d^3 \mathbf{x}'' \ q \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}') \ .
$$
Indeed, we get
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3 \mathbf{x}'' \ q \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}''}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}''|^3} = q \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ ,
$$
which agrees with our original formula for the electric field of a point charge.

Stepping up to one-dimension, we can imagine a line of charge in space, for example a long, thin charged wire. If $d\boldsymbol{\ell}'$ is an infinitesimal segment of this line of charge, we can define a *line charge density* $\lambda(\mathbf{x}')$ by the formula
$$
dq = d\boldsymbol{\ell}' \ \lambda(\mathbf{x}') \ .
$$
Then the formula for the electric field becomes
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d\boldsymbol{\ell}' \ \lambda(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
Here it's again understood that we're integrating over the line of charge $\mathcal{C}$, but we'll again usually omit this dependency.

Last, we can imagine a two-dimensional *surface of charge* in space, for example a thin sheet of charge. If $d\mathbf{a}'$ is the area element along this surface of charge, we can define a *surface charge density* $\sigma(\mathbf{x}')$ by the formula
$$
dq = d\mathcal{a}' \ \sigma(\mathbf{x}') \ .
$$
Then the formula for the electric field becomes
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d\mathbf{a}' \ \sigma(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
$$
Again, it's understood we're integrating over the whole surface of charge $\mathcal{S}$, which we will usually omit.

We could in principle define charge densities in higher dimensions as well, though we won't since we won't need them. Each of the cases we discussed can be visualized using the figure below.

![](./resources/image-20240602122819510.png){fig-align=center width=300}

### Example: Uniformly Charged Sphere

As a useful example of how to calculate the electric field of a charge distribution, let's consider the case of a uniformly charged sphere. We'll first suppose the sphere is *hollow* with a radius $R$ and a uniform charge $Q = 4\pi R^2 \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is a constant surface density.

Given the symmetry of the problem it's natural to work in spherical coordinates. By symmetry, it's not hard to see that the electric field for the hollow sphere must *always* point in the radial direction. To see why, notice that any source point we pick on the sphere will have an opposite point $180^\circ$ away at the same altitude. Since the charge is uniform both source points will cancel all but the radial component of the field when added together. We thus just need to find the single scalar $E(r)$, where
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = E(r) \mathbf{e}_r \ .
$$
To find $E(r)$ we need to take the inner product of $\mathbf{E}$ with $\mathbf{e}_r$. In terms of the separation vector $\boldsymbol{\xi} = \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'$, we have
$$
E(r) = \int d\mathbf{a}' \ \frac{\sigma}{\xi^3} \boldsymbol{\xi} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r \ .
$$
To make headway we need to find the area element $d\mathbf{a}'$, the relative distance $\xi = |\boldsymbol{\xi}|$, and the dot product $\boldsymbol{\xi} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r$. Starting with the area element, for a sphere it's simply the volume element in spherical coordinates with $r=R$ and without the $dr$ integral,
$$
d\mathbf{a}' = R^2 \sin\theta' d\theta' d\phi' \ .
$$
Now we need to find $\xi \equiv |\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|$, which is somewhat trickier. Without loss of generality we can assume that the field point lies on the $z$-axis, so that $\mathbf{x} = r \mathbf{e}_z$. Then an arbitrary source point $\mathbf{x}' = R \mathbf{e}_r$ on the sphere will subtend a polar angle $\theta'$ with the $z$-axis. Using the law of cosines on the triangle shown in the figure below, we can see that
$$
\xi^2 = r^2 + R^2 - 2Rr \cos\theta' \ .
$$
![](./resources/image-20240602122925138.png){fig-align=center width=300}

Next we need to calculate the dot product $\boldsymbol{\xi} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r$. Using the geometric formula for the dot product and the above triangle, we see
$$
\boldsymbol{\xi} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r = \xi \cos\alpha = \frac{r - R\cos\theta'}{\xi} \ .
$$
We can now plug all of these values into the electric field integral and just plug away. We'll integrate over the whole sphere,
$$
\begin{align*}
E(r) &= \int d\mathbf{a}' \ \frac{\sigma}{\xi^3} \boldsymbol{\xi} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r \\
&= \int \sigma R^2 \sin\theta' d\phi' d\theta' \frac{r - R\cos\theta'}{\xi^3} \\
&= R^2 \sigma \int_0^{2\pi} \sin\theta' d\phi' \int_0^{\pi} d\theta' \frac{r - R\cos\theta'}{(r^2 + R^2 - 2Rr \cos\theta')^{3/2}} \\
&= 2\pi R^2 \sigma \int_0^{\pi} \sin\theta' d\theta' \frac{r - R\cos\theta'}{(r^2 + R^2 - 2Rr \cos\theta')^{3/2}} \ .
\end{align*}
$$
To evaluate the remaining integral we make use of a very common substitution in electrostatics. Supposing $f(\cos\theta)$ is some function we'd like to integrate in spherical coordinates, we can always let $\mu = \cos\theta'$ and $d\mu = -\sin\theta' d\theta'$. Then we have
$$
\int_0^\pi \sin\theta d\theta \ f(\cos\theta) = \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \ f(\mu) \ .
$$
Using this useful trick, the integral for the field simplifies slightly to
$$
E(r) = 2\pi R^2 \sigma \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \ \frac{r - R\mu}{(r^2 + R^2 - 2Rr \mu)^{3/2}} \ .
$$
The remaining integral can be done by breaking up the numerator and doing another substitution. In the end we get
$$
\begin{align*}
E(r) &= \frac{2\pi R^2 \sigma}{r^2} \bigg[\frac{r\mu - R}{\sqrt{r^2 + R^2 - 2R\mu}} \bigg]_{\mu=-1}^1 \\
&= \frac{2\pi R^2 \sigma}{r^2} \bigg[\frac{r-R}{|r-R|} + 1 \bigg] \ .

\end{align*}
$$
Now, notice that the first term in the brackets will always be $\pm 1$ depending on the sign of $r-R$. When we're inside the sphere $r < R$, and so this term is $-1$. This means that inside the sphere the electric field must vanish, with $E(r) = 0$.

Outside the sphere $r > R$, and so the first term is $+1$​. In this case we have
$$
E(r) = \frac{4\pi R^2 \sigma}{r^2} = \frac{Q}{r^2} \ .
$$
Notice that this looks identical to Coulomb's law for the electric field. Evidently, a hollow sphere behaves as a point charge $Q$​ for any field points outside the sphere.

QUICKLY DO SOLID SPHERE

This was clearly a difficult integration problem. We'll see a *much* easier way to find the electric field of a sphere when we introduce Gauss's law. For now, just be aware that in practice calculating the electric field of a charge distribution straight from the definition is almost always very challenging, and often impossible. Indeed, much of the rest of our study of electrostatics from here on will be about finding simpler ways to calculate the electric field of an arbitrary charge distribution.

## Gauss's Law

While Coulomb's law is perhaps the most intuitive way to find the electric field of some charge distribution, it's usually not the best way, nor is it the most illuminating. Just as in classical mechanics we express trajectories in terms of ordinary differential equations, when dealing with fields it's often convenient to express them in terms of partial differential equations. We know from the Helmholtz theorem that any field can be fully characterized by its divergence and its curl. In this section we'll derive the formula for the divergence of the electric field, known as *Gauss's law*. We'll return later to the curl and put them together.

If we think of an electric field in terms of field lines, we already know we can think of the field as the *flux density* of field lines generated by a charge distribution. This suggests it's useful to more formally define what we mean by the flux of a field.

 Suppose $\mathcal{S}$ is some surface of interest, closed or not. The *electric flux* through $\mathcal{S}$​ is defined by
$$
\Phi_\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \int_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
$$
Intuitively, this just says that flux as the *net* number of field lines passing through the surface area of $\mathcal{S}$​. The more net field lines passing through the surface, the higher the flux. This is why we can think of the electric field as the electrostatic flux density, since it's in a sense just the flux per unit area through some given surface.

Note the use of the phrase *net* number of field lines here is important because flux is actually a *signed* quantity since each field line can pass through the surface on either side, which flips the sign of $\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}$​​. If a field line passes through the surface and back out the other direction, it contributes nothing to the flux.

Moreover, note that the definition of flux as given depends entirely on which surface $\mathcal{S}$ we choose. We should expect that in general $\Phi_\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})$ will be different for different surfaces. However, as we'll soon see the flux is indeed unique for *closed* surfaces that enclose the same charge distribution.

What we'd like to do is find a way to relate the flux to the source charge density $\rho$ in some way, since we're in practice usually trying to find $\mathbf{E}$ given some known distribution of source charges. To do that let's start by trying to find the flux of a point charge $q$ located at the origin. For the flux surface $\mathcal{S}$ we'll choose a sphere of radius $r$ centered on the point charge. For a point charge centered at the origin, we must have
$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = q \frac{\mathbf{x}}{|\mathbf{x}|^3} = \frac{q}{r^2} \mathbf{e}_r \ .
$$
For a sphere of radius $r$ the area element is $d\mathbf{a} = r^2 d\Omega \mathbf{e}_r$, where $d\Omega$ is the differential *solid angle* $d\Omega = \sin\theta d\theta d\phi$. Integrating over all $\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}$ to get the flux, we then have
$$
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \int d\Omega \ r^2 \frac{q}{r^2} \mathbf{e}_r \cdot \mathbf{e}_r = 4\pi q \ .
$$
Thus, for a point charge, the flux through a sphere enclosing the charge is just $4\pi q$. This is in fact true for *any* closed surface enclosing the charge, not just a sphere. To see why, suppose $\mathcal{S}$ is some arbitrary closed surface containing the charge, shaped like a potato let's say. Then

$$
\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = |\mathbf{E}| |\mathbf{n}| \cos\alpha da = \frac{q}{r^2} \cos\alpha da \ ,
$$
where $\alpha$ is the outward angle between $\mathbf{E}$ and the surface normal $\mathbf{n}$ at the field point $\mathbf{x}$. But, we also must have a new area element of $da = \frac{r^2}{\cos\alpha} d\Omega$ since the surface is no longer spherical. All together, this means the non-spherical behavior of the surface becomes immaterial to the flux, and we again get
$$
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \int d\Omega \ \frac{r^2}{\cos\alpha} \frac{q}{r^2} \cos\alpha = 4\pi q \ .
$$
What about if the charge is outside the closed surface though? What happens then? Intuitively we should expect the flux to be zero, since any field line flowing into the surface must also flow out at some point. Indeed this is what happens. Any flux of $\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}$ passing into the surface will have a corresponding flux $-\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}$ on the opposite side where the field line passes back out of the surface. This can most easly be shown from the figure below.

![image-20240504023749549](./resources/image-20240504023749549.png){fig-align=center width=300}

Thus, the flux for a point charge through any closed surface is $4\pi q$ if the point charge is inside the surface, and zero if the point charge is outside the closed surface.

From here we can easily use the principle of superposition to find the flux of any charge distribution through a closed surface. If $Q_{\text{enc}}$ is the total charge enclosed by a closed surface $\mathcal{S}$, then we have
$$
\boxed{
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = 4\pi Q_{\text{enc}}
} \ .
$$
In this formula we've defined one version of Gauss's law, the *integral form*. That is, the total flux of the electric field through a closed surface is proportional to the charge contained inside the surface.

EDIT HERE







Before using this formula to solve several important electrostatics problems let's quickly get what we originally sought in this section: a differential equation for the electric field in terms of the charge distribution. To do that we'll express the enclosed charge as a volume integral of the charge density,
$$
Q_{\text{enc}} = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \ ,
$$
where $\mathcal{V}$ is the volume enclosed by the closed surface $\mathcal{S}$. Next, we'll use the divergence theorem to rewrite the flux integral as a volume integral of the divergence of $\mathbf{E}$,
$$
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \ .
$$
Plugging these two into the integral form of Gauss's Law and moving everything to one side, we then have
$$
\int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \big[\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} - 4\pi\rho\big] = 0 \ .
$$
Now, the only way this integral can be zero is for the integrand to be be zero as well. This then implies
$$
\boxed{
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 4\pi\rho
} \ .
$$
This is the *differential form* of Gauss's Law. It gives us a differential equation to find $\mathbf{E}$ if $\rho$ is known. Of course, actually solving this equation is easier said than done. We'll come back to that later.

For now let's show how we can use the integral form of Gauss's Law to solve a few convenient problems. Gauss's Law is most useful when a problem has certain symmetries we can recognize. 

- Work the three common examples: line charge, sheet, sphere

## Electric Potential

Let's now look at the field equation for the curl of the electric field. From the Helmholtz theorem, we know that any vector field can be fully determined by knowing both its divergence and its curl. This means that once we figure out what the curl of the electric field is we've fully specified what the electric field must be from two partial differential equations.

There are a few ways we can proceed. One way is to just directly take the curl of the integral expression for the electric field and grind out an answer. This works fine, but we'll take an easier approach. Recall from classical mechanics that a force $\mathbf{F}$ is *conservative* if and only if its curl vanishes, $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0}$. We also know that any central force, a force that depends only on the relative distance between particles, is conservative. The Coulomb force is clearly a central force since it only depends on the relative distance between charges. In particular, this means we automatically must have that the curl of the electric field vanishes in electrostatics,
$$
\boxed{
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{0}
} \ .
$$
This completes our picture of field equations we need to fully determine the electric field in electrostatics. All that remains at this point is analyzing the two field equations to see what they're telling us. We've already done that with the divergence, deriving Gauss's Law. Let's now look into the curl equation to see what it implies.

We know from vector calculus that any vector field whose curl vanishes must have a scalar potential whose gradient fully determines the vector field. The potential for the electric field is called the *electrostatic potential* $\phi(\mathbf{x})$, with
$$
\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi \ .
$$
Since the force exerted by the field on a point charge $q$ is given by $\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative, we know that it has a potential energy $U(\mathbf{x})$ that must evidently be proportional to $\phi(\mathbf{x})$,
$$
U(\mathbf{x}) = q\phi(\mathbf{x}) \ .
$$
This means we can interpret the elecrostatic potential as the potential energy per unit charge exerted on a test particle placed in the electric field. The units for the electric potential are evidently energy per unit charge. In SI units this means the potential has units of Joules per Coulomb, which is called the *Volt*. In Gaussian units the potential has units of ergs per ESU, sometimes called the *stat-volt*, with $1 \ \frac{\text{erg}}{\text{esu}} \approx 300 \ \text{V}$​​.

### Integral Form

In the simplest place where the charge distribution is just a single point charge $q'$ we already know what $\mathbf{E}$ is from Coulomb's Law. We can use that to figure out what the electric potential for a point charge is. Observe if we can recover $\mathbf{E}$ by taking
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{q'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|} \ .
$$
Using the same logic as we did did for the electric field, this means that the electric potential due to a charge distribution $\rho$ is just
$$
\boxed{
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \int_{\mathcal{V}'} d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\rho(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|} 
}\ .
$$
Unlike the integral for the electric field, for the electric potential we now only have one scalar integral to evaluate instead of 3. Obviously, this greatly simplifies the problem we need to solve. Let's work a few examples to see that. But first let's say a word about what the "field lines" look like for the electric potential.

Since the electric field is the gradient of the potential, and gradients always point normal to their contour surfaces, the potential must evidently be contour surfaces for the electric field. These surface of constant potential are called *equipotentials*. They'll always be surfaces perpendicular to the electric field lines.

- Work the previous examples again, using electric fields to find the potentials

### Poisson's Equation

Using the electrostatic potential we can combine the two field equations for the electric field into one field equation for the potential. Since the existence of the potential already satisfies the curl constraint, we just need to plug it into Gauss's Law to satisfy the divergence constraint. Using $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi$, we have
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \nabla \cdot (-\nabla \phi) = 4\pi\rho \ .
$$
Recognizing that this is just the Laplacian for the potential, we thus have
$$
\boxed{
\nabla^2 \phi = -4\pi\rho
} \ .
$$
This is called *Poisson's Equation*. It gives us a second order PDE we can use to find the potential if the source charge distribution is known. In deriving Poisson's Equation, we've converted two first order differential equations for the vector field $\mathbf{E}$ into a single second order differential equation for the scalar field $\phi$. This means that solving Poisson's Equation given some set of boundary conditions will fully give us all of the information we need to determine $\phi$, and hence $\mathbf{E}$ as well. For this reason, Poisson's Equation could easily be considered the single most important equation in electrostatics.

Perhaps the most important reason the potential is nice is that instead of solving for 3 equations, the 3 components of the electric field, with the potential we only need solve a single equation. In this sense, the electric field is evidently redundant, since each of its components are obtained from the same scalar field.

If we like, we can also invert the equation $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi$ to get an equation for $\phi$ in terms of $\mathbf{E}$. Suppose $\mathbf{x}_g$ is some chosen fixed reference point, called the *ground point*. Then by the fundamental theorem of calculus we have
$$
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = -\int_{\mathbf{x}_g}^{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}') \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell}' \ .
$$
Usually we'll choose the *ground point* such that $\phi(\mathbf{x}_g) \equiv 0$. This can be any point we like, but for our purposes it'll usually be most convenient to choose the ground point at infinity. But in many practical applications the ground point may be chosen arbitrarily to simplify the problem.

For example, when dealing with *electric circuits* the ground point is usually taken to be the negative terminal point. Such a *potential difference* is often called a *voltage* in electronics. Voltages are frequently among the most important electricity-related quantities measured in the lab, along with *currents*, which we'll get to later.

## Electrostatic Energy

When talking about energy in electrostatics we have to be a bit careful which energy we're talking about. We've already seen one form of energy: The potential energy arising due to the work done in moving a charge $q$ through an external electric field. This is just $U = q\phi$, where $\phi$ is the electric potential associated to the external electric field $\mathbf{E}$​​. Note this field is assumed to be due to all the other source charges in space, ignoring $q$. In the continuum limit we can express this as an integral over the charge density,
$$
U = \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi(\mathbf{x}) \ .
$$
This isn't the only form of potential energy we can think about though. In fact, it's often more useful to ask a different question: What is the work done to assemble the source charge distribution that gives rise to $\mathbf{E}$ in the first place? To answer this question it helps to imagine bringing each source charge in from space one-by-one and placing it at its source point. Each placement will give rise to its own potential energy. Adding all of these energies together will give us what we seek.

Suppose we have some set of source charges $q_1, q_2, \cdots, q_N$ giving rise to the source charge distribution. Suppose initially that all of these source charges are placed at infinity, where we'll define the potential energy to be zero. 

Now suppose we bringing in only the first charge $q_1$ and place it at position $\mathbf{x}_1$. Since there's no electric potential initially, the work done to place this first charge must evidently be zero, $W_1 = 0$​.

Now suppose we've placed charge $q_1$ and now bring in the second charge $q_2$ and place it at $\mathbf{x}_2$. In this case there's now an electric potential due to $q_1$ that we have to overcome in order to place $q_2$. Thus, the work done to place $q_2$ is
$$
W_2 = q_2 \frac{q_1}{|\mathbf{x}_2 - \mathbf{x}_1|} \ .
$$
We've now placed charges $q_1$ and $q_2$. Let's now bring in charge $q_3$ and place it at $\mathbf{x}_3$. By superposition, the work done to place $q_3$ is just the sum of the potential energies due to the point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ already placed. That is,
$$
W_3 = q_3 \frac{q_1}{|\mathbf{x}_3 - \mathbf{x}_1|} + q_3 \frac{q_2}{|\mathbf{x}_3 - \mathbf{x}_2|} \ .
$$
FIGURE

Hopefully by now we can spot the pattern. Suppose we want to place the $j$<sup>th</sup>  charge $q_j$ in place at $\mathbf{x}_j$. By superposition,
$$
W_j = q_j \sum_{i<j} \frac{q_i}{|\mathbf{x}_j - \mathbf{x}_i|} = \frac{1}{2} q_j \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{q_i}{|\mathbf{x}_j - \mathbf{x}_i|} \ .
$$
In the last equation we used the fact that we can always write $\sum_{i < j} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j}$ to simplify the summation somewhat. This can easily be seen, for example, by placing the summation elements inside a matrix and observing that the condition $i < j$ means to sum only the entries in the upper triangle, and since $i,j$ are symmetric in this case, that's just half the sum of the upper and lower triangles (excluding the diagonal) since the matrix will be symmetric as well.

Now, the work done to place *all* of these charges in place is just the sum of all these contributions,
$$
W = \sum_{j=1}^N U_j = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^N q_j \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{q_i}{|\mathbf{x}_j - \mathbf{x}_i|} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^N q_j \phi_i(\mathbf{x}_j) \ .
$$
This work done we can think of as the potential energy $U$ stored in all of the source charges. In the continuum limit we can replace the sum over the source charges with an integral over the source charge distribution to get
$$
U = \frac{1}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi(\mathbf{x}) \ .
$$
It's worth stopping for a moment to ask how *this* potential energy differs from our first definition of potential energy as the work required to move a test charge in the presence of the external electric field. Evidently the first definition of potential energy is essentially just half the second, even though they mean very different things.

It's useful to write the potential energy to place the source charges it in a more illuminating way. From Gauss's Law, we know that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 4\pi \rho$. Solving for $\rho$ and using integration by parts, we can evidently rewrite $U$ as
$$
\begin{align*}
U &= \frac{1}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi(\mathbf{x}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \frac{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})}{4\pi} \phi(\mathbf{x}) \\
&= \frac{1}{8\pi} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \big(-\nabla \phi(\mathbf{x})\big) \\
&= \frac{1}{8\pi} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Here we assume the surface term from the integration by parts vanishes as we integrate over all space. This will be true so long as $\phi \mathbf{E}$ goes to zero faster than $\frac{1}{r^2}$, which is a realistic assumption for well-localized charge distributions. In the end, we evidently get that the potential energy to assemble all of the source charges is proportional to the square of the electric field,
$$
U = \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \frac{1}{8\pi} |\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})|^2 \ .
$$
This result is interesting in that it gives us another way to interpret this form of potential energy. We can think of the work done to assemble all of the source charges equivalently as the potential energy stored in the electric field itself. It's useful to define the integrand as an *energy density* $u(\mathbf{x})$, in which case we can write
$$
\boxed{
u(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{1}{8\pi} |\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})|^2
} \ .
$$
At this point it's worth stopping to more closely analyze a few of the assumptions we made in deriving this second form of the potential energy stored in the electric field. We made two important assumptions:

1. The surface term in the integration by parts will vanish. This will be true so long as we integrate to infinity and the term $\phi \mathbf{E}$ goes to zero faster than $\frac{1}{r^2}$. As long as the source charge distribution is well-localized this is realistic, since we'd then expect that $\phi \mathbf{E} \sim \frac{1}{r^3}$ at infinity. This isn't true, however, for infinite charge distributions like the infinite line charge or the infinite sheet. In cases like that we must either include the surface integral term, or use the first integral form to find $U$​.

2. Self energies are ignorable. Notice in our transition from the finite sum to the integral form we "smeared out" the requirement that $i \neq j$ in the sum for the electric potential. As long as we imagine only integrating over field points away from the source charge distribution this is fine. If we don't though the potential energy will actually be infinite! To see why, observe if we attempt to find the potential energy for a point charge at the origin using the second form we get
   $$
   U = \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \frac{1}{8\pi} |\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})|^2 = \int_0^\infty 4\pi r^2 dr \ \frac{1}{8\pi} \bigg(\frac{q}{r^2}\bigg)^2 = \infty \ .
   $$
   However, if we use the first integral form for the potential energy we'd get
   $$
   U = \frac{1}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^\infty 4\pi r^2 dr \ q \delta(\mathbf{x}) \frac{q}{r} = 0 \ ,
   $$
   as we'd expect. Clearly then there's a problem arising from the inclusion of the self energies in the second form of the integral. So what's going on? One way to think about it is that the self energy terms include the energy necessary to introduce each charge from the vaccuum. In this sense, self energies are tied up with vacuum energies, the energy stored in the vacuum of space itself. Understanding the vacuum energy requires quantum field theory, and is still an active area of research to this day.
