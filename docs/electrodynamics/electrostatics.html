<p>As is custom in electromagnetism, we’ll begin our study of the subject by focusing on the simple case of <em>electrostatics</em>. Electrostatics is the behavior of static distributions of charges and the forces they exert on other charged objects. Historically the subject was developed to study <em>macroscopic</em> phenomena. For this reason, certain abstractions we’ll make in the subject should be viewed as idealizations that are convenient for the study of macroscopic phenomena, but fail to have any real meaning at the <em>microscopic</em> level, where quantum mechanical descriptions are needed.</p>
<section id="coulombs-law" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coulombs-law">Coulomb’s Law</h2>
<p>We can start the subject in any number of ways, for example by just stating Maxwell’s equations and studying their implications. We’ll instead stick to the more usual convention, where we start by assuming the force laws of classical mechanics along with some empirical facts about electric charges and the forces between them.</p>
<p>We’ll assume that forces are <em>vectors</em>, meaning they have magnitude and direction. Being vectors, forces obey the principle of <em>superposition</em>, meaning the combined effect of two forces exerted on a body is given by their vector sum.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, it was discovered that aside from mass, every physical body has associated to it another scalar quantity called <em>electric charge</em>, which can take on any real value, positive, negative, or zero. From these facts and other experiments, Coulomb discovered that the force between two static, charged bodies satisfies the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The force between the two charges depends linearly on the magnitude of each charge. The larger the magnitude, the stronger the force between them.</li>
<li>The force obeys an inverse square law nature similar to gravity. That is, the strength of the force between the two charges varies with the inverse square of the distance between them.</li>
<li>As with gravity, the force is directed along the line of force joining the two charges.</li>
<li>The force is <em>attractive</em> if the two bodies have charges of <em>opposite</em> sign, and <em>repulsive</em> if the two bodies have charges of the <em>same</em> sign. If either body has zero charge there is no force between them.</li>
</ul>
<section id="coulombs-law-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coulombs-law-1">Coulomb’s Law</h3>
<p>Putting all of these properties together we get <em>Coulomb’s Law</em>. Suppose we have two point particles with charges <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> located at positions <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_2\)</span> respectively. Then according to Coulomb’s Law, the force charge <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> experiences due to charge <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{F}_{12} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2|^2} \mathbf{e}_{12} \ .
\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{e}_{12}\)</span> is the unit vector pointing from <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span>. By Newton’s third law, the force <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> experiences due to <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> is equal and opposite, with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_{21} = -\mathbf{F}_{12}\)</span>. Since this force depends only on the distance between the two point charges it’s a <em>central force</em>, which implies that energy is conserved in electrostatics. We’ll say more about elecrostatic energy later.</p>
<p>The proportionality constant <span class="math inline">\(k_e\)</span> has value and dimensions that depend on the choice of units used. In this course we’ll mostly use the <em>Gaussian</em> system of units, where <span class="math inline">\(k_e \equiv 1\)</span> and the mechanical units are measured in CGS units. This means force is measured in <em>dynes</em> and distance in <em>centimeters</em>. Evidently then, in the Gaussian system of units charge must have units of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\text{dyne} \cdot \text{cm}^2}\)</span>. We give this unit of charge a name, called the <em>electrostatic unit</em> or <em>esu</em>, where <span class="math inline">\(1 \ \text{esu} \approx 3.3 \cdot 10^{-10} \ \text{C}\)</span> in SI units. In Gaussian units, Coulomb’s Law thus simplifies to <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{F}_{12} = \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2|^2} \mathbf{e}_{12} \ .
\]</span> Note that as defined Coulomb’s Law really only holds for <em>point charges</em>. That is, for point particles where all charge is localized at a single point. This is of course an abstraction. In reality we deal with larger bodies where the charge may be distributed across the body in some way. We’ll see how to modify Coulomb’s Law the work with more arbitrary distributions of charge below.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-charge" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-charge">What is Charge?</h3>
<p>Before moving on, it’s worth stopping to ask what exactly it is we mean when we say a body has charge. Mathematically, we can think of charge similar to how we think of mass. It’s a scalar quantity associated with a body, except unlike mass it can take on any real value, positive or negative. More fundamentally though, the charge of a body is really an aggregate of charge due to more atomic particles inside the body like electrons and protons.</p>
<p>A body is really a collection of atoms held together in some way, each with some number of protons and electrons. What we think of as charge is really how the electrons and protons are distributed inside the body. Electrons and protons carry the same charge but with opposite sign. In practice most bodies are at least approximately charge neutral, meaning it contains the same number of protons and electrons. If there are more electrons than protons the body has negative charge. If there are fewer electrons than protons the body has positive charge.</p>
<p>In practice, it’s the movement of electrons that control how a material is charged. In some materials, called <em>conductors</em> these electrons move freely around the material, while for materials, called <em>insulators</em>, these electrons stay locked into their respective atoms and only move inside their confined electron clouds. In either case, if the body is charged it implies some deficit or surplus of electrons.</p>
<p>One would think that we should think of charge in terms of electrons and define charge in units of the number of surplus electrons present in the body. However, atomic structure wasn’t known at the time the theory of electromagnetism was first formulated. It was only known that there was a scalar quantity called charge associated to the body, with no understanding of what gives rise to it. It’s for these largely historical reasons that we continue to think of positive charge as moving around inside a body, even though it’s really negatively charged electrons that move around.</p>

<section id="coulomb-vs-gravity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coulomb-vs-gravity">Coulomb vs Gravity</h3>
<p>Given that Coulomb’s Law looks so similar to Newton’s law of gravitation, it’s fair to ask how the forces compare to each other. Let’s suppose we have two particles separated by a distance <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> with masses <span class="math inline">\(m_1, m_2\)</span> and charges <span class="math inline">\(q_1, q_2\)</span> respectively. Since the particles have both mass and charge they’ll feel both a gravitational force <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_g\)</span> and a Coulomb force <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_e\)</span>. We can get an idea of the relative strengths of these two forces by looking at their ratio. In Gaussian units, this is given by <span class="math display">\[
\frac{|\mathbf{F}_e|}{|\mathbf{F}_g|} = \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} \bigg / G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r} = \frac{q_1 q_2}{G m_1 m_2} \ .
\]</span> To get a feel for these values let’s pick a representative particle, the <em>electrons</em>. Then we’d have masses <span class="math inline">\(m_1 = m_2 = m_e\)</span> and charges <span class="math inline">\(q_1 = q_2 = e\)</span>. In Gaussian units, these values are <span class="math display">\[
\ G \approx 6.7 \cdot 10^{-8} \ , \ m_e \approx 9 \cdot 10^{-28} \ , \ e \approx -5 \cdot 10^{-10} \ .
\]</span> Plugging these numbers in, we get <span class="math display">\[
\frac{|\mathbf{F}_e|}{|\mathbf{F}_g|} = \frac{e^2}{G m_e^2} \approx 4 \cdot 10^{42} \ .
\]</span> That is, for two electrons the Coulomb force is 42 orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational force. The difference between the two forces is so stark we can practically speaking neglect the effects of gravity when studying the interactions between electrons, or indeed any small particles. Indeed, this is one reason why in quantum mechanics we rarely consider gravity. On the other hand, larger objects like people, planets, or galaxies tend to be electrically neutral or very close to it. This means in those cases gravity is all there is, and for large masses gravity can obviously be quite substantial.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="electric-fields" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="electric-fields">Electric Fields</h2>
<p>While we could proceed to study this force between charges just as we did in with gravity in classical mechanics, we’ll find it’s useful in electromagnetism to make a further abstraction, the <em>field abstraction</em>. The reason for this is that we want to think of all interactions as <em>local</em>. That is, a particle should only feel the presence of things near by, not things far away. If we think in terms of forces we have to give locality up, since two charges will feel a force no matter how far away they are, so-called “action at a distance”.</p>
<section id="electric-field" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="electric-field">Electric Field</h3>
<p>Instead what we’ll do is imagine that particles interact due to the presence of background fields, and think of these fields as giving rise to forces. Suppose we have a charge <span class="math inline">\(q'\)</span> sitting in space at some position <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}'\)</span>. Suppose we then place an infinitesimal <em>test charge</em> <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> at some other position <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>. By Coulomb’s Law, the test charge will feel a force <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}\)</span> due to <span class="math inline">\(q'\)</span>. We’ll define a vector-valued function of position known as the <em>electric field</em> by the ratio <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{\mathbf{F}}{q} \ .
\]</span> Empirically this ratio is found to be well-defined and independent of the value of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> so long as <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is infinitesimal, with <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{q'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^2} \mathbf{e}_\xi \ .
\]</span> Here for convenience we define the separation vector <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi} \equiv \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'\)</span>, so that the field always points from the location <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}'\)</span> of the <em>source charge</em> <span class="math inline">\(q'\)</span> to the <em>field point</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> where we imagine placing the test charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. The relationship between all these points is shown in the figure below.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="../resources/image-20240616171528590.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" width="400"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Notice that the electric field doesn’t depend on <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> at all. It has a value at every point in space. When a test charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is brought in and placed at a position <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> it feels a force <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})
} \ .
\]</span> Note that the requirement that <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> be an infinitesimal charge in this definition is important. If test charge is high enough, it will distort the background electric field through its presence, in effect making <em>both</em> charges source charges for the field. Also, note that this doesn’t mean that the charge will move in the direction of the electric field. All that will be true is that its force vector will be tangential to the electric field at that point, pointing in the direction of the field if <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is negative, and opposite the field if <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is opposite. The path the charge actually follows through the field may be quite complicated.</p>
<p>We’ll often find it more useful to express the electric field formula in a slightly different way by getting rid of the unit vector. Using the fact that the separation vector can be written <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi} = |\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'| \mathbf{e}_\xi\)</span> we can write the same electric field in the equivalent form <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = q' \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
\]</span> This only defines the electric field due to a single point charge <span class="math inline">\(q'\)</span>. What if instead we have multiple source charges spread out in space. Suppose we instead have <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> point source charges <span class="math inline">\(q_1, q_2, \cdots, q_N\)</span> located at positions <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_N\)</span> respectively. Since forces obey the principle of superposition, we know we can add the force due to each source charge to get the total force, <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{F}_2 + \cdots + \mathbf{F}_N \ .
\]</span> Since the electric field is proportional to the force it must evidently obey the superposition principle as well. Then the combined electric field due to the presence of all of these charges must be given by the sum of each individual field, <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{E}_i(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^N q_i \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i|^3} \ .
\]</span> Again, the combined electric field does not depend on the test charge, only the source charges. If we imagine placing an infinitesimal test charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> it will still feel the combined force <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{E}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The most typical way to visualize vector fields in electromagnetism is via <em>field lines</em>. We imagine that any positive charge emits from it a bunch of lines, called field lines. These field lines follow the direction of the vector field in space, only terminating at negative charges or at infinity. Field lines should never cross each other. The direction of a field line is always from positive charges to negative charges. The strength of the field is captured by the density of field lines. The more field lines there are surrounding a given point in space, the stronger the field at that point. Indeed, we can informally <em>define</em> a vector field as the <em>flux density</em> of field lines, i.e.&nbsp;the number of field lines per unit volume.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of electric field line sketches for a few different configurations of point charges. Notice it’s usually fairly easy to sketch field lines for a given charge configuration, even if finding an expression for the actual electric field of that configuration might be difficult. We’ll see field lines sketched in many figures throughout this course.</p>
<p>FIGURE</p>
<p>Let’s now work a problem involving finding the electric field for a very simple example, the <em>simple dipole</em>.</p>
<section id="example-simple-dipole" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-simple-dipole">Example: Simple dipole</h4>
<p>Suppose we have two like charges of opposite sign separated by a fixed distance along some axis. More formally, suppose we have a positive charge <span class="math inline">\(+q\)</span> located at a point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_+ = \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z\)</span>, and a negative charge <span class="math inline">\(-q\)</span> located at the opposite point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_- = -\frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z\)</span>. Our goal will be to find the electric field for any field point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span>-plane.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="../resources/image-20240811130607078.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" width="300"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>By the superposition principle, the electric field is given by <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_+ + \mathbf{E}_- = q\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_+}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_+|^3} - q\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_-}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_-|^3} \ .
\]</span> To proceed further we first need to find the separation vectors for each charge. We have <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_\pm = r \mathbf{e}_r \mp \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z \ ,
\]</span> Plugging this in and simplifying, we get <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{E} &amp;= q \frac{r \mathbf{e}_r - \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z}{|r \mathbf{e}_r - \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z|^3} - q \frac{r \mathbf{e}_r + \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z}{|r \mathbf{e}_r + \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z|^3} \\
&amp;= q \frac{r \mathbf{e}_r - \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z}{\bigg[r^2 + \big(\frac{d}{2}\big)^2\bigg]^{3/2}} - q \frac{r \mathbf{e}_r + \frac{d}{2} \mathbf{e}_z}{\bigg[r^2 + \big(-\frac{d}{2}\big)^2\bigg]^{3/2}} \\
&amp;= \frac{-qd}{\bigg[r^2 + \big(\frac{d}{2}\big)^2\bigg]^{3/2}} \mathbf{e}_z \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> We can immediately see that the electric field for any point in the <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span>-plane must point along the negative <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis. This can be understood intuitively just by vector subtracting the separation vectors in the figure above and noting that the magnitude of the field for each charge must be the same by symmetry.</p>
<p>This is as far as we can go as is, but we can make one useful simplification. Let’s suppose <span class="math inline">\(r \gg d\)</span>. This is the <em>far field limit</em> where the field point is far away from both charges. In this limit we can ignore the <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d}{2}\)</span> term in the denominator and write <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E} \approx -\frac{qd}{r^3} \mathbf{e}_z \ .
\]</span> This result tells us something interesting. Even far away from the source charges, the dipole doesn’t seem to follow Coulomb’s Law since the field doesn’t fall off as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} \sim \frac{1}{r^2}\)</span>, but rather as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} \sim \frac{1}{r^3}\)</span>. The reason for this is the two charges screen each other, canceling out the monopole field that would usually give rise to a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{r^2}\)</span> term in the field. This causes the field to be weaker than we’d expect for a point charge in the far field limit.</p>
<p>The term <span class="math inline">\(qd \mathbf{e}_z\)</span> has a name. It’s called the <em>dipole moment</em>, denoted by the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span>. The dipole moment is a vector of magnitude <span class="math inline">\(qd\)</span> that points from the negative to the positive charge in a dipole. Using the dipole moment it’s possible to show that for a general field point, not just in the <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span>-plane, we can express the electric field of a dipole in the far field limit as <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E} = \frac{3(\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r) \mathbf{e}_r}{r^3} - \frac{\mathbf{p}}{r^3} \ .
\]</span> Notice the first term is just the projection of the dipole onto the field point direction, which is zero when the two vectors are perpendicular. The dipole turns out to be very important to the theory of electrostatics. We’ll talk about it in more detail in the next chapter when we discuss the multipole expansion.</p>

<section id="continuous-charge-distributions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="continuous-charge-distributions">Continuous Charge Distributions</h3>
<p>In classical electromagnetism we rarely find ourselves dealing with point charges. We’re generally dealing with <em>macroscopic</em> materials containing many charged particles packed densely together. In such cases it’s more convenient to treat those charges not as a sum over all the point charges, but instead as a continuous <em>charge distribution</em>.</p>
<p>A charge distribution can be thought of as a large number of charged point particles packed densely together. Provided the charges are dense enough that we can treat them as continuous, we can define a <em>charge density</em> <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\mathbf{x}')\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[
dq = d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \ .
\]</span> Each <span class="math inline">\(dq\)</span> will give rise to an infinitesimal electric field <span class="math inline">\(d\mathbf{E}\)</span> defined by Coulomb’s Law. Using the principle of superposition, we can then integrate over all these charges over all space to get the electric field of the distribution, <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3}
}\ .
\]</span> Strictly speaking we should only integrate over the volume <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{V}\)</span> of the distribution, but since we can freely define the density to be zero outside the distribution we’ll usually omit this from the formula and assume we’re integrating over all space.</p>
<p>This idea can be seen in the figure below. Here the gray blob is some charge distribution, and <span class="math inline">\(dq\)</span> some infinitesimal element of it. Adding up, or integrating, over all these charges will give the full electric field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})\)</span>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>The field lines for the electric fields of continuous distributions work the same way they do for point charges. The main new thing to be aware of is that field lines will always point <em>normal</em> to the surface of the charge distribution. Again, the field lines will point away from positive charge distributions, and toward negative charge distributions or out to infinity, never crossing.</p>
<p>We’ll often be interested in charge distributions of lower dimension as well, for example lines of charge and sheets of charge. For this reason it’s useful to define charge densities in these dimensions as well. The simplest case is the point charge, which we can think of as a zero-dimensional density. If <span class="math inline">\(q'\)</span> is some point charge located at <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}'\)</span>, we can use the delta function to write <span class="math display">\[
dq = d^3 \mathbf{x} \ q \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}') \ .
\]</span> Indeed, we get <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3 \mathbf{x}'' \ q \delta(\mathbf{x}'' - \mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}''}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}''|^3} = q \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ ,
\]</span> which agrees with our original formula for the electric field of a point charge.</p>
<p>Stepping up to one-dimension, we can imagine a line of charge in space, for example a long, thin charged wire. If <span class="math inline">\(d\ell'\)</span> is an infinitesimal line element of this line of charge, we can define a <em>line charge density</em> <span class="math inline">\(\lambda(\mathbf{x}')\)</span> by the formula <span class="math display">\[
dq = d\ell' \ \lambda(\mathbf{x}') \ .
\]</span> Then the formula for the electric field becomes <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int d\ell' \ \lambda(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
\]</span> Here it’s again understood that we’re integrating over the line of charge <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, but we’ll again usually omit this dependency.</p>
<p>Last, we can imagine a two-dimensional <em>surface of charge</em> in space, for example a thin sheet of charge. If <span class="math inline">\(da'\)</span> is the area element along this surface of charge, we can define a <em>surface charge density</em> <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(\mathbf{x}')\)</span> by the formula <span class="math display">\[
dq = d\mathcal{a}' \ \sigma(\mathbf{x}') \ .
\]</span> Then the formula for the electric field becomes <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \int da' \ \sigma(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
\]</span> Again, it’s understood we’re integrating over the whole surface of charge <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>, which we will usually omit.</p>
<p>We could in principle define charge densities in higher dimensions as well, though we won’t since we won’t need them. Each of the cases we discussed can be visualized using the figure below.</p>

<section id="example-sphere-with-uniform-charge" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-sphere-with-uniform-charge">Example: Sphere with uniform charge</h4>
<p>As a useful example of how to calculate the electric field of a charge distribution, let’s consider the case of a uniformly charged sphere. We’ll first suppose the sphere is <em>hollow</em> with a radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and a uniform charge <span class="math inline">\(Q = 4\pi R^2 \sigma\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is a constant surface density.</p>
<p>Given the symmetry of the problem it’s natural to work in spherical coordinates. By symmetry, it’s not hard to see that the electric field for the hollow sphere must <em>always</em> point in the radial direction. To see why, notice that any source point we pick on the sphere will have an opposite point <span class="math inline">\(180^\circ\)</span> away at the same altitude. Since the charge is uniform both source points will cancel all but the radial component of the field when added together. We thus just need to find the single scalar <span class="math inline">\(E(r)\)</span>, where <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = E(r) \mathbf{e}_r \ .
\]</span> To find <span class="math inline">\(E(r)\)</span> we need to take the inner product of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{e}_r\)</span>. In terms of the separation vector <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi} = \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
E(r) = \int da' \ \frac{\sigma}{\xi^3} \boldsymbol{\xi} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r \ .
\]</span> To make headway we need to find the area element <span class="math inline">\(da'\)</span>, the relative distance <span class="math inline">\(\xi = |\boldsymbol{\xi}|\)</span>, and the dot product <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r\)</span>. Starting with the area element, for a sphere it’s simply the volume element in spherical coordinates with <span class="math inline">\(r=R\)</span> and without the <span class="math inline">\(dr\)</span> integral, <span class="math display">\[
da' = R^2 \sin\theta' d\theta' d\phi' \ .
\]</span> Now we need to find <span class="math inline">\(\xi \equiv |\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|\)</span>, which is somewhat trickier. Without loss of generality we can assume that the field point lies on the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis, so that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x} = r \mathbf{e}_z\)</span>. Then an arbitrary source point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}' = R \mathbf{e}_r\)</span> on the sphere will subtend a polar angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta'\)</span> with the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis. Using the law of cosines on the triangle shown in the figure below, we can see that <span class="math display">\[
\xi^2 = r^2 + R^2 - 2Rr \cos\theta' \ .
\]</span></p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>Next we need to calculate the dot product <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\xi} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r\)</span>. Using the geometric formula for the dot product and the above triangle, we see <span class="math display">\[
\boldsymbol{\xi} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r = \xi \cos\alpha = \frac{r - R\cos\theta'}{\xi} \ .
\]</span> We can now plug all of these values into the electric field integral and just plug away. We’ll integrate over the whole sphere, <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
E(r) &amp;= \int da' \ \frac{\sigma}{\xi^3} \boldsymbol{\xi} \cdot \mathbf{e}_r \\
&amp;= \int \sigma R^2 \sin\theta' d\phi' d\theta' \frac{r - R\cos\theta'}{\xi^3} \\
&amp;= R^2 \sigma \int_0^{2\pi} \sin\theta' d\phi' \int_0^{\pi} d\theta' \frac{r - R\cos\theta'}{(r^2 + R^2 - 2Rr \cos\theta')^{3/2}} \\
&amp;= 2\pi R^2 \sigma \int_0^{\pi} \sin\theta' d\theta' \frac{r - R\cos\theta'}{(r^2 + R^2 - 2Rr \cos\theta')^{3/2}} \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> To evaluate the remaining integral we make use of a very common substitution in electrostatics. Supposing <span class="math inline">\(f(\cos\theta)\)</span> is some function we’d like to integrate in spherical coordinates, we can always let <span class="math inline">\(\mu = \cos\theta'\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\mu = -\sin\theta' d\theta'\)</span>. Then we have <span class="math display">\[
\int_0^\pi \sin\theta d\theta \ f(\cos\theta) = \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \ f(\mu) \ .
\]</span> Using this useful trick, the integral for the field simplifies slightly to <span class="math display">\[
E(r) = 2\pi R^2 \sigma \int_{-1}^1 d\mu \ \frac{r - R\mu}{(r^2 + R^2 - 2Rr \mu)^{3/2}} \ .
\]</span> The remaining integral can be done by breaking up the numerator and doing another substitution. In the end we get $$ <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
E(r) &amp;= \frac{2\pi R^2 \sigma}{r^2} \bigg[\frac{r\mu - R}{\sqrt{r^2 + R^2 - 2R\mu}} \bigg]_{\mu=-1}^1 \\
&amp;= \frac{2\pi R^2 \sigma}{r^2} \bigg[\frac{r-R}{|r-R|} + 1 \bigg] \ .

\end{align*}\]</span> $$ Now, notice that the first term in the brackets will always be <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> depending on the sign of <span class="math inline">\(r-R\)</span>. When we’re inside the sphere <span class="math inline">\(r &lt; R\)</span>, and so this term is <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. This means that inside the sphere the electric field must vanish, with <span class="math inline">\(E(r) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Outside the sphere <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; R\)</span>, and so the first term is <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>​. In this case we have <span class="math display">\[
E(r) = \frac{4\pi R^2 \sigma}{r^2} = \frac{Q}{r^2} \ .
\]</span> Notice that this looks identical to Coulomb’s Law for the electric field. Evidently, a hollow sphere behaves as a point charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>​ for any field points outside the sphere.</p>
<p>Using the result we have for the hollow sphere, let’s quickly figure out what the electric field should be for a <em>solid sphere</em> of uniform charge. The only difference now is that the sphere is 3-dimensional. We can work directly from our previous solution. We just have to replace <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> by an integration variable <span class="math inline">\(r'\)</span>. However we do have to be slightly careful, since the charge density is only nonzero inside the sphere. This means we integrate up to <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> for field points outside the sphere, and up to <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> otherwise. We can take care of both cases by integrating up to <span class="math inline">\(r_{\min} \equiv \min(r, R)\)</span>. Then we have <span class="math display">\[
E(r) = \frac{4\pi\rho}{r^2} \int_0^{r_{\min}} dr' \ r'^2 = \frac{4\pi\rho}{3} \frac{r_{\min}^3}{r^2} \ .
\]</span> Now, if <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; R\)</span> we’re outside the sphere, and <span class="math inline">\(r_{\min} = R\)</span>. In that case we have <span class="math display">\[
E(r) = \frac{4\pi R^3 \rho}{3r^2} = \frac{Q}{r^2} \ .
\]</span> Here we used the fact that in 3 dimensions the total charge of the sphere becomes <span class="math inline">\(Q = \frac{4\pi}{3} R^3 \rho\)</span>​. Notice that we get the same result we got in the hollow sphere. The electric field is again that of a point charge outside the sphere.</p>
<p>Inside the sphere, however, things change. When <span class="math inline">\(r \leq R\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(r_{\min} = r\)</span>, in which case <span class="math display">\[
E(r) = \frac{4\pi\rho}{3} r = \frac{Qr}{R^3} \ .
\]</span> Now the electric field inside the sphere is apparently linear in <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, not zero. It’s easy to check that the two results match at the boundary of the sphere where <span class="math inline">\(r=R\)</span>. Note that in either case the electric field is still just the enclosed charge <span class="math inline">\(Q_{\text{enc}} = \frac{4\pi}{3} r_{\min}^3 \rho\)</span> divided by <span class="math inline">\(r^2\)</span>. This means any charge outside the enclosed sphere contributes nothing to the field. In the figure below we plot the field strengths <span class="math inline">\(E(r)\)</span> for both the hollow and solid spheres to show the difference between the two.</p>
<p>FIGURE</p>
<p>This was clearly a difficult integration problem. We’ll see a <em>much</em> easier way to find the electric field of a sphere shortly. For now, just be aware that in practice calculating the electric field of a charge distribution straight from the definition is almost always very challenging, and often impossible. Indeed, much of the rest of our study of electrostatics from here on will be about finding simpler ways to calculate the electric field of an arbitrary charge distribution.</p>

<p>While Coulomb’s Law is perhaps more directly connected to experiment and the historical progression of electromagnetism, it’s usually not the most illuminating nor useful way to understand and calculate electric fields. Just as in classical mechanics we found it useful to express Newton’s law as an ordinary differential equation for the trajectory of a particle, in electromagnetism we’ll find it more useful to express Coulomb’s Law as a set of <em>partial differential equations</em> for the electric field.</p>
<section id="flux" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="flux">Flux</h3>
<p>We know from the Helmholtz theorem that any well behaving vector field can be fully characterized by its divergence and its curl. This means if we can find the divergence and curl of the electric field we have an equivalent characterization for the field in terms of two linear partial differential equations. We’ll derive the divergence of the electric field in this section, saving the curl of the electric field for the next section before discovering a neat way to combine them both together.</p>
<p>To make a start we need to define the idea of the <em>flux</em> of a vector field. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is some surface of interest we’d like to calculate the flux through. In electromagnetism we call this surface a <em>Gaussian surface</em>. The <em>flux</em> <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> due to the field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> is defined by the integral <span class="math display">\[
\Phi \equiv \int_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
\]</span> Note when we need to specify which field we’re calculating the flux of, we’ll write <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_\mathbf{E}\)</span> to be more specific.</p>
<p>Informally, we can think of the flux as the total number of <em>signed</em> field lines passing through some specified surface of interest. By signed, we mean that the field lines passing through the positively oriented side of the surface contribute positive flux, while those passing through the negatively oriented side of the surface contribute negative flux. This means that flux itself will be a signed quantity indicating the net tendency of a field to flow into or out of a given surface. In particular, this means if the same field line passes in and out of the same surface it contributes nothing to the flux.</p>
<p>FIGURE</p>
<p>As defined, the flux depends entirely on the surface <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> we choose. Different surfaces will have a different flux. However, in practice we’ll usually be interested in <em>closed surfaces</em>. In that case, we’ll show that the flux depends only on the charge distribution enclosed by the surface, not on the geometric properties of the surface itself. To do that we need to find a way to relate the flux of an electric field to the charge distribution in some way.</p>

<section id="integral-form-of-gausss-law" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="integral-form-of-gausss-law">Integral Form of Gauss’s Law</h3>
<p>Let’s start by trying to find the flux through a sphere of radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> centered on a point charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> located at the origin. Since <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is located at the origin we have <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{0}\)</span>, meaning the electric field is simply <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = q \frac{\mathbf{x}}{|\mathbf{x}|^3} = \frac{q}{r^2} \mathbf{e}_r \ .
\]</span> For a sphere of radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> the area element is given by <span class="math inline">\(d\mathbf{a} = r^2 d\Omega \mathbf{e}_r\)</span>. Here <span class="math inline">\(d\Omega\)</span> is the differential <em>solid angle</em>, which is just a useful shorthand for angular components of the area element, <span class="math inline">\(d\Omega \equiv \sin\theta d\theta d\phi\)</span>. To find the flux, we need only now integrate to get <span class="math display">\[
\Phi = \oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \int d\Omega \ r^2 \frac{q}{r^2} \mathbf{e}_r \cdot \mathbf{e}_r = 4\pi q \ .
\]</span> We’ve thus shown that the flux of a point charge through a sphere is just proportional to the charge. Notice in this result that the radius of the Gaussian surface didn’t enter into the picture at all. No matter what it cancels out. This fact is unique to inverse square fields, like electricity or gravity. Any field of this type will have the property that its flux is proportional to its source “charge”.</p>
<p>But thus far we’ve only shown this holds for the flux through a sphere. What about an arbitrary closed surface? In fact the result is the same. To see why, suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is some arbitrary closed surface containing <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the outward angle between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> and the surface normal <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{n}\)</span>. Then we evidently have <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = |\mathbf{E}| |\mathbf{n}| \cos\alpha da = \frac{q}{r^2} \cos\alpha da \ .
\]</span> It now seems like we should get a different flux. However, we have to look closer at the area element <span class="math inline">\(da\)</span> first. Since the surface is no longer spherical we have to divide by another factor of <span class="math inline">\(\cos\alpha\)</span> to account for the fact that we’re only interested in the flux through the outward normal component of the surface, <span class="math display">\[
da = \frac{r^2}{\cos\alpha} d\Omega \ .
\]</span> Putting these together we get exactly what we claimed, <span class="math display">\[
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \int d\Omega \ \frac{r^2}{\cos\alpha} \frac{q}{r^2} \cos\alpha = 4\pi q \ .
\]</span> This is only true though when the charge is contained <em>inside</em> the surface. What if it’s <em>outside</em> the surface? We already said informally the flux in that case should be zero, since any field lines going into the surface also comes out, offsetting the flux. Indeed, if <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}\)</span> is some contribution to the flux, there will be a corresponding contribution <span class="math inline">\(-\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}\)</span> on some other part of the Gaussian surface that will cancel out the first contribution. This can be seen geometrically in the figure below.</p>

<p>Putting these two results together, we’ve shown that if <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is a point charge and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is some closed surface, then <span class="math display">\[
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} =
\begin{cases}
4\pi q, &amp; q \ \text{inside} \ \mathcal{S} \\
0, &amp; q \ \text{outside} \ \mathcal{S} \ .
\end{cases}
\]</span> By the principle of superposition, this result must also hold for some arbitrary distribution of charge, the flux through a closed surface depends <em>only</em> on the charge <span class="math inline">\(Q_{\text{enc}}\)</span> enclosed inside the surface, <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = 4\pi Q_{\text{enc}}
} \ .
\]</span> This important result is called the <em>integral form</em> of <em>Gauss’s Law</em>. It says that the total flux of the electric field through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge inside the surface.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="differential-form-of-gausss-law">Differential Form of Gauss’s Law</h3>
<p>The enclosed charge can be found by integrating the charge density over the volume <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{V}\)</span> of the closed surface, <span class="math display">\[
Q_{\text{enc}} = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \ .
\]</span> Indeed, if we plug this into Gauss’s Law we get <span class="math display">\[
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = 4\pi \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \ .
\]</span> Also, notice we can use of the divergence theorem to convert the flux integral into a volume integral, <span class="math display">\[
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \ .
\]</span> Putting the two integrals together and moving everything to one side, we have <span class="math display">\[
\int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \big[\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} - 4\pi\rho\big] = 0 \ .
\]</span> Since this integral must vanish for any valid integrand we must have <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 4\pi\rho
} \ .
\]</span> This result is known as the <em>differential form</em> of Gauss’s Law. It’s the main thing we sought to derive in this section. It gives us an expression for the divergence of the electric field in terms of the source charge distribution.</p>
</section>
<section id="examples" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Gauss’s Law can sometimes be very convenient to directly find the electric field in situations where the charge distribution has a high level of symmetry. As we’ve shown, as long as two closed surfaces contain the same charge distribution they will also have the same flux. What we can thus do is use this freedom to choose a Gaussian surface that simplifies the problem. The simplest thing we could imagine doing is to choose a Gaussian surface such that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbf{E}|\)</span> is constant along the surface. In that case, we’d have <span class="math display">\[
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = |\mathbf{E}| A \ ,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the total surface area of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>. Then the integral form of Gauss’s Law simplifies greatly to <span class="math display">\[
|\mathbf{E}| = \frac{4\pi Q_{\text{enc}}}{A} \ .
\]</span> For this to work though the charge distribution really needs to have a high level of symmetry. There are essentially three situations where we can do this: for infinite lines of charge, infinite sheets of charged, and charged spheres. Let’s look at each.</p>
<section id="example-infinite-line-of-uniform-charge" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-infinite-line-of-uniform-charge">Example: Infinite line of Uniform Charge</h4>
<p>Consider a line of charge of infinite length and infinitesimal width, so we can treat the line as one-dimensional. We’ll suppose the line is oriented along the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis and carries a constant charge per unit length of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>​. Our goal is to find its electric field. We could do this the hard way as before, but in this case we can do it much more easily using Gauss’s Law, so that’s what we’ll do.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>By symmetry, the electric field should depend only on the cylindrical radius <span class="math inline">\(\varrho\)</span>. To see why, pick a random field point in the <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span>-plane. Now pick a random source point at a height <span class="math inline">\(z'\)</span> along the wire. Then there must also be an opposite source point at a height <span class="math inline">\(-z'\)</span>. If we add the two field vectors together, their <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-components will cancel, leaving only a contribution in the <span class="math inline">\(\varrho\)</span>-direction. We thus must conclude that the electric field has the property that <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = E(\varrho) \mathbf{e}_\varrho \ .
\]</span> All that remains thus is to find <span class="math inline">\(E(\varrho)\)</span>. Now, the electric field must be constant along cylinders of constant <span class="math inline">\(\varrho\)</span>. This means we have a natural Gaussian surface on which to apply Gauss’s Law. We’ll choose cylinders of radius <span class="math inline">\(\varrho\)</span> and length <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> centered on the wire. Since only the sides of the cylinder contribute to the flux, we need only consider the area of the sides of the cylinder, ignoring the two caps. This means the flux of the field is <span class="math display">\[
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = |\mathbf{E}| A = E(\varrho) \cdot 2\pi \varrho z
\]</span> Inside this cylinder, the enclosed charge is <span class="math inline">\(Q_{\text{enc}} = \lambda z\)</span>. Applying Gauss’s Law, we thus have <span class="math display">\[
E(r) \cdot 2\pi \varrho z = 4\pi \lambda z \ .
\]</span> Solving for <span class="math inline">\(E(\varrho)\)</span>, we finally have <span class="math display">\[
E(\varrho) = \frac{2\lambda}{\varrho} \ .
\]</span> Thus, the electric field of an infinitely long wire of uniform charge is inversely proportional to its distance from the wire. Notice that this seems to contradicts Coulomb’s Law, which predicts that far away from the wire the electric field should go like the inverse square of the distance. Why the contradiction? This comes from our assumption that the wire was infinitely long. If the wire had only a finite length, we would indeed recover Coulomb’s Law in the far field limit.</p>

<section id="example-infinite-sheet-of-uniform-charge" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-infinite-sheet-of-uniform-charge">Example: Infinite sheet of uniform charge</h4>
<p>We’ll now consider not an infinite <em>line</em> of uniform charge, but an infinite <em>flat sheet</em> of uniform charge. We’ll suppose this sheet is oriented in the <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span>-plane and has infinitesimal thickness, so we can treat the sheet as 2-dimensional with a constant surface charge density <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>​.</p>

</div>
<p>By symmetry, we’ll argue that the electric field must always point away from the sheet in the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> direction. To see why, pick a random field point at a height <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> above (or below) the sheet, centered at the origin. Pick a random source point <span class="math inline">\((r',\varphi')\)</span> along the sheet. Now, there must be an opposite source point at <span class="math inline">\((r',\varphi'+\pi)\)</span> for which the two field vectors will cancel in all but the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-direction. This means <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \pm E(z) \mathbf{e}_z \ .
\]</span> All that thus remains is to find <span class="math inline">\(E(z)\)</span>. Clearly this field is constant along surfaces of constant <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. This means that any Gaussian surface with a flat top and bottom will do, since only the field through the top and bottom of the surface contribute anything to the flux. Such a surface is historically called a <em>pillbox</em>. Examples of pillboxes include prisms and cylinders. All that matters is that the top and bottom are flat, and the sides are perpendicular to the sheet. We’ll thus choose any pillbox with equal top and bottom areas <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and some arbitrary height, as shown in the figure.</p>
<p>Since the field is constant on the top and bottom of the Gaussian surface and only points in the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-direction, the flux is given by <span class="math display">\[
\oint_\mathcal{S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} = |\mathbf{E}| \cdot 2A = E(z) \cdot 2 A \ .
\]</span> The pillbox encloses a charge given by <span class="math inline">\(Q_{\text{enc}} = \sigma A\)</span>. Plugging these into Gauss’s Law and solving for <span class="math inline">\(E(z)\)</span>, we finally have <span class="math display">\[
E(z) = 2\pi\sigma \ .
\]</span> That is, the electric field strength of an infinite sheet of uniform charge is constant, no matter how far away from the surface we are, with the only difference being the direction (pointing above or below the surface). Yet again this seems to contradict Coulomb’s Law, since the field would still be constant infinitely far from the sheet. This can be rectified, however, by noting that the sheet chosen is infinite in extent. For a finite sheet, Coulomb’s Law would still hold in the far field limit.</p>

\]</span> The enclosed charge <span class="math inline">\(Q_{\text{enc}}\)</span> is just the total charge of the sphere, <span class="math inline">\(Q = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \sigma\)</span>. Plugging these into Gauss’s Law, we have <span class="math display">\[
E(r) = \frac{Q}{r^2} \ .
\]</span> This of course is exactly what we expected. The electric field of a uniformly charged sphere behaves as a point charge outside the sphere. What does Gauss’s Law say when we’re inside the sphere though? In that case there’s no enclosed charge, so <span class="math inline">\(Q_{\text{enc}} = 0\)</span>. This means Gauss’s Law just gives exactly what we’ve already shown, that there’s no electric field inside the sphere, <span class="math display">\[
E(r) = 0 \ .
\]</span> What if the sphere is now solid instead of hollow, with a constant charge density <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>? Outside the sphere the result is the same. Inside the sphere though the enclosed charge will be the volume of the Gaussian surface times the charge density, which is just <span class="math inline">\(Q(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho\)</span>. Plugging this into Gauss’s Law, we have <span class="math display">\[
E(r) = \frac{Q(r)}{r^2} = \frac{4\pi\rho}{3} r \ .
\]</span> That is, inside of a uniformly charged solid sphere the electric field is <em>linear</em> in the radius. When <span class="math inline">\(r=R\)</span>​ of course this will equal the equation for the field outside the sphere, where the field will start to decrease as an inverse square law.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scalar-potential">Scalar Potential</h2>
<p>Recall that we’re trying to find a way to fully characterize the electric field with a set of field equations. We know it’s sufficient for this purpose to find formulas for the divergence and curl of the field in terms of the source charges. We just found a formula for the divergence, which gave us Gauss’s Law. We’ll now see what the curl of the electric field should be and see what that implies.</p>
<section id="curl-of-electric-field" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="curl-of-electric-field">Curl of Electric Field</h3>
<p>From vector calculus, we know that finding the curl of a vector field is in some sense equivalent to finding the line integral of the field around a closed path. More formally, Stoke’s theorem says that if <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is some closed loop with interior surface <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\oint_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} =  \int_\mathcal{S} (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) \cdot d\mathbf{a} \ .
\]</span> What we’ll thus do is first find the line integral and from that get the curl. As we did with Gauss’s Law, we’ll start with the simplest case of a point charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> centered at the origin. This means we have <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \frac{q}{r^2} \mathbf{e}_r \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \frac{q}{r^2} dr \ .
\]</span> Here we used the fact that in spherical coordinates the line element is <span class="math inline">\(d\boldsymbol{\ell} = dr \mathbf{e}_r + rd\theta \mathbf{e}_\theta + r \sin\theta d\varphi \mathbf{e}_\varphi\)</span>. This means that between any two points on the line <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{b}\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[
\int_\mathbf{a}^\mathbf{b} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \frac{q}{|\mathbf{a}|} - \frac{q}{|\mathbf{b}|} \ .
\]</span> In particular, if we integrate around a closed loop <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> we must conclude that the line integral vanishes. The line integral over a closed loop is often called the <em>circulation integral</em>. It represents the total contribution of the field in moving around the closed loop, or equivalently the work per unit charge done in moving around the closed loop. Evidently for a point charge this circulation integral must be zero.</p>
<p>Of course, there is nothing special about a point charge. By the principle of superposition we can consider any arbitrary distribution of charges as well by summing the contribution of each of the point charges inside. We thus conclude that for <em>any</em> distribution of charge giving rise to a total electric field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> the circulation integral must vanish in electrostatics, <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\oint_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = 0
} \ .
\]</span> We can recover the curl of the field by apply Stoke’s theorem, from which we immediately see that the curl vanishes as well, <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{0}
} \ .
\]</span> Note that this was perhaps a long-winded way of saying something that should already be obvious to us: We know from classical mechanics that any <em>conservative force</em> has the property that its curl vanishes. Since the Coulomb force is a central force we know it must be conservative, and hence its curl must vanish, but since the electric field is just force per unit charge, its curl must vanish as well, which is what we just proved.</p>
</section>
<section id="scalar-potential-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scalar-potential-1">Scalar Potential</h3>
<p>From vector calculus, we know that any vector field whose curl vanishes must be the gradient of some scalar field. This follows from the fact that the circulation integral vanishes, and hence the line integral between any two points must be path independent and hence a well defined function of the two endpoints. If we call this scalar field <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, this means we have <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\mathbf{E} = - \nabla \phi
}\ .
\]</span> Note the minus sign is merely a convention. We’ll see why we include this in a moment. In electromagnetism we call <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> the <em>scalar potential</em>, or more simply the <em>potential</em> depending on the context. The units of scalar potential are evidently energy per unit charge. In SI units the scalar potential has units of <em>volts</em>, or Joules per Coulomb. In Gaussian units the potential has units of ergs per ESU, sometimes called the <em>statvolt</em>, with <span class="math inline">\(1 \ \frac{\text{erg}}{\text{esu}} \approx 300 \ \text{V}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using the fundamental theorem of calculus we can invert the previous formula to get the potential in terms of the field. If <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> is the field point of interest and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{g}\)</span> is some fixed reference point, often called the <em>ground point</em>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = -\int_\mathbf{g}^\mathbf{x} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \ .
\]</span> In much of theoretical electromagnetism we choose the ground point to be at infinity, where we insist the scalar potential must vanish for localized charge distributions. In this scenario, we then have <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \int_\mathbf{x}^\infty \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \ .
\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{b}\)</span> are two points in space, the potential between them, or <em>potential difference</em>, is given by <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{b}) - \phi(\mathbf{a}) = -\int_\mathbf{a}^\mathbf{b} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \ .
\]</span> The potential difference is often called the <em>voltage</em> in more applied fields since it’s measured in volts, often denoted by <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V\)</span> when the context is clear. The voltage is what is typically measured in the lab, for example by differencing the potential between the positive and negative terminals of some power source.</p>
<p>Notice that the integral formula for the scalar potential looks an awful lot like the formula for work in terms of force. Recall that the work done in moving a particle from a point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span> to a point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{b}\)</span> via an exerted force <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_{\text{ex}}\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[
W = \int_\mathbf{a}^\mathbf{b} \mathbf{F}_{\text{ex}} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \ .
\]</span> Since the force one must exert to move against the field is just minus the force generated by the field itself, we must evidently have <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_{\text{ex}} = -q\mathbf{E}\)</span>. Plugging this in and factoring out the charge from both sides, we can see that the work done is proportional to the potential difference between the two points, <span class="math display">\[
W = -q \int_\mathbf{a}^\mathbf{b} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = q \big(\phi(\mathbf{b}) - \phi(\mathbf{a})\big) \ .
\]</span> This means we can think of the scalar potential as the work done in moving a unit charge from infinity to its current location in the presence of an external electric field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span>. Indeed, this is why we include the minus sign in the definition of the scalar potential as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} = - \nabla \phi\)</span>​, to ensure that the potential has the same sign as the work done on the charge.</p>
<p>Provided we set the ground point at infinity, the work done in moving the charge from infinity to some location <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> must evidently be <span class="math inline">\(W = q\phi(\mathbf{x})\)</span>. This is of course just the potential energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, provided we define <span class="math inline">\(U(\infty)\equiv 0\)</span>. Thus, for a point charge moving in the presence of an external field, its potential energy is just <span class="math inline">\(U = q\phi\)</span>. For a general charge distribution we need only use the superposition principle to replace the charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> by a volume integral over the charge density <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\mathbf{x})\)</span>, in which case we have <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
U = \int d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi(\mathbf{x})
} \ .
\]</span> Remember, this is only true for charges moving in the presence of an external electric field. This is <em>not</em> true for the charges used to assemble the distribution giving rise to the field itself. We’ll see what that potential energy must be momentarily.</p>
<section id="example-hollow-sphere-with-uniform-charge" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-hollow-sphere-with-uniform-charge">Example: Hollow sphere with uniform charge</h4>
<p>Let’s now try to calculate the scalar potential for the uniformly charged hollow sphere. Since we already know what the electric field should be, all we need to do is calculate the line integral. Recall the electric field for a uniformly charged hollow sphere of radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> centered at the origin is given by <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) =
\begin{cases}
\mathbf{0} \ , &amp; r &lt; R \ , \\
\frac{Q}{r^2} \mathbf{e}_r \ , &amp; r \geq R \ . \\
\end{cases}
\]</span> To find the potential at a given field point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> we need to integrate from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> to infinity. Since the field is radially symmetric, we can write <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = E(r) dr\)</span>. When the field point lies outside the sphere <span class="math inline">\(r \geq R\)</span>, and we get <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\phi(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= \int_\mathbf{x}^\infty \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \\
&amp;= Q \int_r^\infty \frac{dr}{r^2} \\
&amp;= \frac{Q}{r} \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> For field points inside the sphere we have to integrate the field inside the sphere as well. When <span class="math inline">\(r &gt; R\)</span> we get <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\phi(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= \int_\mathbf{x}^\infty \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \\
&amp;= \int_r^R dr \ 0 + Q \int_R^\infty \frac{dr}{r^2} \\
&amp;= \frac{Q}{R} \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> Thus, the potential for a solid sphere is evidently given by <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{Q}{R} \ , &amp; r &lt; R \ , \\
\frac{Q}{r} \ , &amp; r \geq R \ . \\
\end{cases}
\]</span> We can verify we got the correct answer if we wish by taking the gradient to recover the field. For example, outside the sphere we have <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = -\nabla \phi(\mathbf{x}) = - \frac{d}{dr} \frac{Q}{r} \mathbf{e}_r = \frac{Q}{r^2} \mathbf{e}_r \ .
\]</span> Notice that while the electric field is zero inside the sphere, the potential is not. It’s a constant value throughout. Also notice that the two sides match at <span class="math inline">\(r=R\)</span>, meaning the potential is continuous even though the field is not at <span class="math inline">\(r=R\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-solid-sphere-with-uniform-charge" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-solid-sphere-with-uniform-charge">Example: Solid sphere with uniform charge</h4>
<p>We can also calculate the potential of the solid sphere if we wish. Outside the sphere the result is the same. Inside the sphere we have to use the fact that the field is no longer zero, but linear in <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{Qr}{R^3} \mathbf{e}_r\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(r &lt; R\)</span> we thus have <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\phi(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= \int_\mathbf{x}^\infty \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \\
&amp;= \frac{Q}{R^3} \int_r^R dr \ r + Q \int_R^\infty \frac{dr}{r^2} \\
&amp;=  \frac{Q}{R^3} \bigg(\frac{R^2}{2} - \frac{r^2}{2}\bigg) + \frac{Q}{R} \\
&amp;= \frac{Q}{2R} \bigg(3 - \frac{r^2}{R^2}\bigg) \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> Thus, for a solid sphere the potential is evidently given by <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{Q}{2R}\bigg(3 - \frac{r^2}{R^2}\bigg) \ &amp;, &amp; r &lt; R \ , \\
\frac{Q}{r} \ &amp;, &amp; r \geq R \ . \\
\end{cases}
\]</span> Again, the potential is continuous at <span class="math inline">\(r=R\)</span>. In fact so is its gradient since the field is also continuous at <span class="math inline">\(r=R\)</span>.</p>

<section id="example-infinite-sheet-with-uniform-charge" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-infinite-sheet-with-uniform-charge">Example: Infinite sheet with uniform charge</h4>
<p>Let’s briefly work an example involving an infinite charge distribution. We’ll choose the uniformly charged infinite sheet. In this case we can no longer take infinity as the ground point. Instead we’ll choose <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{g} = \mathbf{0}\)</span> as the ground point. Recall for the infinite sheet the electric field for <span class="math inline">\(z \geq 0\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = 2\pi\sigma \mathbf{e}_z\)</span>. This means <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = E(z) dz\)</span>, and so we have <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = -\int_\mathbf{0}^\mathbf{x} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = -2\pi\sigma \int_0^z dz = -2\pi\sigma z \
\]</span> One can quickly check that we’d get the same result when <span class="math inline">\(z &lt; 0\)</span>. Thus, the potential for the infinite sheet is just <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = -2\pi\sigma z \ ,

<section id="integral-formula" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="integral-formula">Integral Formula</h3>
<p>We’ll now see what Coulomb’s Law looks like in terms of the scalar potential. In the previous chapter we proved the identity <span class="math display">\[
\nabla \frac{1}{r} = -\frac{\mathbf{e}_r}{r^2} = -\frac{\mathbf{x}}{r^3} \ .
\]</span> Replacing <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|\)</span> and noting that we’re differentiating with respect to the field point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\nabla \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = -\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
\]</span> Multiplying both sides by the charge density <span class="math inline">\(-\rho(\mathbf{x}')\)</span> and integrating over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}'\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
-\nabla \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\rho(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} = \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} \ .
\]</span> Recognizing that the righthand side is just the electric field and matching with the formula <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} = - \nabla \phi\)</span>, we thus have <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \frac{\rho(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|}
}\ .
\]</span> This is the generalized form of Coulomb’s Law expressed for the scalar potential. Note by replacing <span class="math inline">\(d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}')\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(da \ \sigma(\mathbf{x}')\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(d\ell \ \lambda(\mathbf{x}')\)</span> we can get the equivalent integrals for the potential of surface or line charge distributions. Do be advised, however, that these formulas <em>only</em> hold for <em>localized</em> charge distributions. For charge distributions that extend to infinity we may need to modify these equations, for example by choosing a different ground point than infinity for our calculations.</p>
<p>We can use this formula to calculate the potential directly from the charge density itself rather than having to first calculate the electric field. Indeed this is extremely useful. Recall for the electric field we needed to calculate <em>three</em> integrals, one for each component. Since the potential is a scalar we only need to calculate a single integral without needing to worry about the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'\)</span> at all. Once we have the potential, we can easily calculate the electric field.</p>
<p>Before working a few examples, let’s try to get a visual understanding of what the potential of a charge distribution looks like. We already have an idea how to visualize the electric field of a distribution using field lines. Since the field is just the gradient of the potential, we know from vector calculus that the field must always point perpendicular to surfaces of constant potential. These constant potential surfaces are called <em>equipotentials</em>. Indeed, it’s just as easy to draw equipotentials as it is to draw field lines. For example, the equipotential surfaces of a point charge are shown in the figure below.</p>
<p>FIGURE</p>
<p>Let’s now work some examples to show how much nicer this integral formula is to use than the one for the electric field.</p>
<section id="example-finite-wire-with-uniform-charge" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-finite-wire-with-uniform-charge">Example: Finite wire with uniform charge</h4>
<p>Let’s find the potential of a uniformly charged wire of finite length. Suppose a wire of length <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> has a uniform charge <span class="math inline">\(Q = \lambda L\)</span>. We’ll assume that it is oriented along the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis with its center at the origin.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Assuming the wire has negligible thickness we can use the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-dimensional version of the integral formula for the potential, <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \int d\ell' \ \frac{\lambda(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is constant along the wire and the wire is centered on the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis we can set <span class="math inline">\(d\ell' = dz'\)</span> and write the integral as <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \lambda \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \frac{dz'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} \ .
\]</span> All that remains now is to find <span class="math inline">\(\xi = |\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|\)</span>. We’ll work in cylindrical coordinates. Since each source point is along the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis we can write <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}' = z' \mathbf{e}_z\)</span>. For the field point we’ll write <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x} = \varrho \mathbf{e}_\varrho + z \mathbf{e}_z\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the radial cylindrical coordinate. This means we have <span class="math display">\[
\xi^2 = \varrho^2 + (z - z')^2 \ .
\]</span> Plugging this into the integral for the potential, we’re left to evaluate the following integral, <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \lambda \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \frac{dz}{\sqrt{\varrho^2 + (z - z')^2}} \ .
\]</span> We can evaluate this integral by making the substitution <span class="math inline">\(x = \frac{z - z'}{\varrho}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(dx = -\frac{z'}{\varrho}\)</span> to get <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = -\lambda \int_{\frac{z+L/2}{\varrho}}^{\frac{z-L/2}{\varrho}} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} = -\lambda \log(\sqrt{1 + x^2} + x) \bigg |_{x=\frac{z+L/2}{\varrho}}^{\frac{z-L/2}{\varrho}} \ .
\]</span> Evaluating the endpoints and simplifying a bit, we get <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \lambda \log\bigg[\frac{\sqrt{\varrho^2 + (z + L/2)^2} - (z - L/2)}{\sqrt{\varrho^2 + (z - L/2)^2} - (z + L/2)}\bigg] \ .
\]</span> This is the full potential in terms of a general field point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> in cylindrical coordinates. We still don’t easily have an idea what this potential looks like. Let’s try to find its equipotentials. To do that we’ll need to introduce <em>elliptical coordinates</em>. Define <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
u &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \sqrt{\varrho^2 + (z + L/2)^2} + \sqrt{\varrho^2 + (z - L/2)^2}\bigg)  \ , \\
v &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \sqrt{\varrho^2 + (z + L/2)^2} - \sqrt{\varrho^2 + (z - L/2)^2}\bigg) \ .\\
\end{align*}
\]</span> If we plug these new coordinates into the potential and simplify, a little tedious algebra will show that the potential is given by <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \lambda \log\bigg[\frac{u + L/2}{u - L/2}\bigg] \ .
\]</span> Now, we can immediately see from this result that the equipotentials will be the curves such that <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is constant. Though perhaps not obvious, the constant surfaces of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> are ellipsoids of revolution about the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis. This means that the equipotentials are just ellipsoids. This should be intuitively obvious. Since the wire has a uniform charge, its equipotentials should be surfaces of constant distance from the wire, which would be ellipsoids. These equipotentials are shown in the figure below.</p>
<p>FIGURE</p>
<p>We can further verify the correctness of this result by considering two limits: the infinite wire limit where <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbf{x}| \ll L\)</span>, and the far field limit where <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbf{x}| \gg L\)</span>. In the infinite wire limit we have <span class="math inline">\(\varrho, z \ll L\)</span>. In that limit we can neglect <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and use the binomial approximation then to write <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) \approx \lambda \log\bigg[\frac{\sqrt{\varrho^2 + (L/2)^2} + L/2}{\sqrt{\varrho^2 + (L/2)^2} - L/2}\bigg] \approx \lambda \log\bigg[\frac{L/2 + L/2}{L/2 - L/2 + 2\varrho^2/L}\bigg] \approx \lambda \log \frac{L^2}{2\varrho^2} \ .
\]</span> Simplifying this expression a bit, we get <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) \approx -2\lambda \log \frac{\varrho}{L} - \lambda \log 2 \ .
\]</span> To verify whether this is correct we can take its gradient to recover the electric field, in which case we get <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \approx - \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial \varrho} \mathbf{e}_r \approx \frac{2\lambda}{\varrho} \mathbf{e}_\varrho \ .
\]</span> This is of course exactly what we should expect for an infinite wire of uniform charge, as we’ve derived before.</p>
<p>In the far field limit we have <span class="math inline">\(r, z \gg L\)</span>. For convenience let’s suppose <span class="math inline">\(z=0\)</span>. In that case, we can neglect the <span class="math inline">\(L/2\)</span> terms inside the roots and use the Taylor series approximation <span class="math inline">\(\log(1+x) \approx x\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is small to write <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) \approx \lambda \log\bigg[\frac{\sqrt{\varrho^2 + (L/2)^2} + L/2}{\sqrt{\varrho^2 + (L/2)^2} - L/2}\bigg] \approx \lambda \log\bigg[\frac{\varrho + L/2}{\varrho - L/2}\bigg] \approx \lambda \log\bigg[1 + \frac{L}{\varrho}\bigg] \approx \frac{\lambda L}{r} \ .
\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(Q = \lambda L\)</span> is just the total charge of the wire, we get the Coulomb potential <span class="math inline">\(\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{Q}{r}\)</span> in the far field limit, as we’d expect.</p>

\nabla \times \mathbf{E} &amp;= \mathbf{0} \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> We can use the scalar potential to combine these two first-order field equations into a single second-order equation for the scalar potential. We’ve already shown the curl equation is equivalent to the formula <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi\)</span>. Plugging this into Gauss’s Law, we get <span class="math display">\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \nabla \cdot (-\nabla \phi) = 4\pi\rho \ .
\]</span> Recognizing that this is just the Laplacian of the scalar potential, we thus have <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\nabla^2 \phi = -4\pi\rho
} \ .
\]</span> This second-order differential equation is called <em>Poisson’s Equation</em>. It’s fully equivalent to the two field equations we derived before. This means that instead of solving two vector first order differential equations to find the electric field, we need only solve Poisson’s equation subject to any boundary conditions and then take the gradient to get the electric field. Indeed, for this reason Poisson’s equation is perhaps the most important equation in electrostatics. It’s the most generally useful way to find the electric field of a charge distribution. We’ll spend considerable time analyzing and solving this equation in the next chapter.</p>
<p>For now, just observe that Coulomb’s Law is indeed a solution of Poisson’s equation. To see why we can use the following formula derived in the last chapter: <span class="math display">\[
\nabla \cdot \frac{\mathbf{e}_r}{r^2} = 4\pi\delta(\mathbf{x}) \ .
\]</span> Replacing <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'\)</span> and differentiating only with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) \\
&amp;= -\nabla \cdot \int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} \\
&amp;= -\int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') \nabla \cdot \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|^3} \\
&amp;= -\int d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ \rho(\mathbf{x}') 4\pi \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}') \\
&amp;= -4\pi \rho(\mathbf{x}) \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> We’ll see another proof that Coulomb’s Law satisfies Poisson’s equation in the next chapter via the use of Green’s functions. For now, just note that this is only a <em>particular</em> solution, not a general solution. The <em>general</em> solution will also depend on the boundary conditions in the problem as well. Indeed, we can add to <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> any function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> satisfying <span class="math inline">\(\nabla^2 f = 0\)</span> and their sum will also satisfy Poisson’s Equation. An equation of the form <span class="math inline">\(\nabla^2 f = 0\)</span> is called <em>Laplace’s Equation</em>. We’ll say more on this in the next chapter.</p>

<section id="surfaces-of-charge" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="surfaces-of-charge">Surfaces of Charge</h3>
<p>Recall from our discussion of Gauss’s Law that we saw something seemingly peculiar: The electric field of an infinite sheet of uniform charge is discontinuous at the surface. Below the surface the field is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} = -2\pi\sigma \mathbf{e}_z\)</span>, while above the surface the field is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} = +2\pi\sigma \mathbf{e}_z\)</span>. Evidently, crossing the surface causes the field to change discontinuously by an amount <span class="math inline">\(\Delta |\mathbf{E}| = 4\pi\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>In fact this is generally true for surfaces of charge. To see why, suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is some smooth surface of arbitrary shape carrying a surface charge density <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. Pick a point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> on this surface. Since the field for a general surface can point in any direction, what we can do is decompose it into two components, one perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> and one parallel to <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>​, <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}^\perp + \mathbf{E}^\parallel \ .
\]</span> To deal with the perpendicular component, what we can do is apply Gauss’s Law just like we did with the infinite sheet. We’ll choose an infinitesimally high and very thin pillbox with top and bottom areas <span class="math inline">\(\delta A\)</span> as the Gaussian surface, where <span class="math inline">\(\delta A\)</span> is so small that any deviations in the curvature of the surface <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> are negligible inside the Gaussian surface. If <span class="math inline">\(E_+\)</span> is the value of the field above the surface and <span class="math inline">\(E_-\)</span> is the value of the field below the surface, by Gauss’s Law we must have <span class="math display">\[
4\pi\sigma \delta A = \int \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a} \approx (E_+^\perp - E_-^\perp) \delta A \ .
\]</span> That is, the perpendicular component of the field again undergoes a discontinuous change of <span class="math inline">\(4\pi\sigma\)</span> crossing the surface, <span class="math display">\[
E_+^\perp - E_-^\perp = 4\pi\sigma \ .
\]</span> What about the parallel component? Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is some small closed loop around the point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> on the surface, so small the curvature of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is negligible. We’ve already seen that the circulation integral must be vanish. This means we have <span class="math display">\[
0 = \oint_\mathcal{C} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \approx (E_+^\parallel - E_-^\parallel) \ell \ .
\]</span> From this we must conclude that the parallel component is indeed continuous on the surface, with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}_+^\parallel = \mathbf{E}_-^\parallel\)</span>. We can put these two results together by using the normal vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{n}\)</span>​ to write <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}_+ - \mathbf{E}_- = 4\pi\sigma \mathbf{n} \ .
\]</span> What about the scalar potential? In fact the potential <em>is</em> continuous across the surface of charge. To see why, suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_-\)</span> is some point infinitesimally below the surface and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_+\)</span> some other point infinitesimally above the surface. If the two points are separated by a distance <span class="math inline">\(\delta\ell\)</span>, the potential difference between these two points must be given by <span class="math display">\[
\phi_+ - \phi_- = -\int_{\mathbf{x}_-}^{\mathbf{x}_+} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} \approx -(E_+  + E_-) \delta\ell \ .
\]</span> Since the right-hand side is infinitesimal, we can conclude that the potential difference crossing the surface must be zero, <span class="math display">\[
\phi_+ = \phi_- \ .
\]</span> Since we’ll be solving Poisson’s equation in the next chapter, let’s go ahead and formulate these conditions as a set of boundary conditions for the potential and its gradient. For that purpose it’ll be convenient to express the condition for the electric field as a <em>normal derivative</em> of the potential. If we define the normal derivative by <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} \equiv \nabla \phi \cdot \mathbf{n} \ ,
\]</span> we can write the two boundary conditions for the potential across a surface of charge as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\phi_+ - \phi_- &amp;= 0 \ , \\
\frac{\partial \phi_+}{\partial n} - \frac{\partial \phi_-}{\partial n} &amp;= -4\pi\sigma \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> Here it’s of course understood that <span class="math inline">\(\phi_+\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_-\)</span> refer to points infinitesimally above and below the surface, respectively.</p>

<section id="field-energy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="field-energy">Field Energy</h2>
<p>We’ve already discussed the idea of potential energy in electrostatics. In particular, for a point charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> moving in the presence of an external electric field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> that’s generated by some charge distribution <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, its potential energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[
U = \int d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi(\mathbf{x}) \ .
\]</span> This is not the only form of potential energy we can ask about however when it comes to a field. We can also ask a slightly different question: What is the work done required to assemble the source charge distribution to begin with, or equivalently, what is the potential energy stored in the source charge distribution?</p>
<p>To make a start at answering this question we’ll suppose the charge distribution is discrete, so that the total charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is just a sum of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>​ point charges, <span class="math display">\[
Q = \int d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \approx q_1 + q_2 + \cdots + q_N \ .
\]</span> We’ll suppose that initially all point charges are at infinity, separated from each other by an infinite distance. This means that initially there is no potential present in space. What we’ll now do is bring the point charges in from infinity one at a time and place them at their respective locations in space and calculate the work done, hence the potential energy, to assemble each charge in the presence of the charges already in place.</p>
<p>First, suppose we bring in charge <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> from infinity and place it at its source point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_1\)</span>. Since there is no potential present initially, the work done to move this charge to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_1\)</span> must evidently be zero. The work done is evidently thus <span class="math inline">\(U_1 = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, with <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> in position we’ll bring in <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span>. Suppose we bring in <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> from infinity and place it at <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_2\)</span>. This time, however, there is a potential generated by the presence of <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\phi_1(\mathbf{x}_2) = \frac{q_1}{|\mathbf{x}_2 - \mathbf{x}_1|} \ .
\]</span> This means the work done to bring in charge <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> in the presence of <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
U_2 = q_2 \phi_1(\mathbf{x}_2) = q_2 \frac{q_1}{|\mathbf{x}_2 - \mathbf{x}_1|} \ .
\]</span> With <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> in place we’ll now bring in <span class="math inline">\(q_3\)</span> and place it at <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_3\)</span>. This time there are now two potentials we need to deal with, the potentials of both <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span>. By superposition, the work done to bring in charge <span class="math inline">\(q_3\)</span> must be <span class="math display">\[
U_3 = q_3 \phi_1(\mathbf{x}_3) + q_3 \phi_2(\mathbf{x}_3) = q_3 \bigg(\frac{q_1}{|\mathbf{x}_3 - \mathbf{x}_1|} + \frac{q_2}{|\mathbf{x}_3 - \mathbf{x}_1|}\bigg) \ .
\]</span> Hopefully by now we can spot the pattern. If the first <span class="math inline">\(i-1\)</span> charges <span class="math inline">\(q_1, q_2, \cdots, q_{i-1}\)</span> are already in place and we then bring in charge <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> from infinity and place it at position <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_i\)</span>, the work done must be <span class="math display">\[
U_i = q_i \sum_{j&lt;i} \phi_j(\mathbf{x}_i) = q_i \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \frac{q_j}{|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j|} \ .
\]</span> Here the sum over <span class="math inline">\(j &lt; i\)</span> means to sum from <span class="math inline">\(j=1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(j=i-1\)</span>. This is to make sure we only sum over the point charges already in place, not the ones we haven’t brought in yet.</p>
<p>Now, the <em>total</em> potential energy <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{U}\)</span> to assemble <em>all</em> of these charges into place is just the sum of each of these contributions, <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{U} = \sum_{i=1}^N U_i = \sum_{i=1}^N q_i \sum_{j&lt;i} \phi_j(\mathbf{x}_i) \ .
\]</span> It’ll be useful to rewrite the sum over all <span class="math inline">\(j &lt; i\)</span> in a slightly different way by observing that the potential is symmetric in <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(\phi_j(\mathbf{x}_i) = \phi_i(\mathbf{x}_j)\)</span>. This means we can write the same sum by summing over all <span class="math inline">\(j \neq i\)</span> and dividing by two to avoid double counting, <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N q_i \bigg(\sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \phi_j(\mathbf{x}_i)\bigg) \ .
\]</span> Observe next that the interior sum is just the <em>total</em> potential exerted on charge <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> due to all other charges <span class="math inline">\(q_j\)</span>. Call this potential <span class="math inline">\(\phi(\mathbf{x}_i)\)</span>. We can now transition back to the continuum by making the replacement <span class="math inline">\(\sum q_i \rightarrow \int d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x})\)</span>​ to get <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{2} \int d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi(\mathbf{x})
}\ .
\]</span> This is the potential energy stored in the entire charge distribution. Notice how similar it looks to the potential energy we derived before for a charge distribution in the presence of an external electric field, <span class="math inline">\(U = \int d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi(\mathbf{x})\)</span>. On the surface, the only difference between the two evidently is the factor of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>. However, we must keep in mind that the <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> used to find <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{U}\)</span> is the <em>source</em> charge distribution, not an external charge distribution like the one used to find <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>​.</p>
<p>We can think of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{U}\)</span> as the potential energy stored in the source charge distribution, but we can also think of it equivalently as the potential energy stored in the electric field itself. To see why it’s helpful to rewrite the integral in a slightly different way. From Gauss’s Law, we know that <span class="math inline">\(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 4\pi \rho\)</span>. Plugging this into the formula for <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{U}\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{8\pi} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \phi \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \ .
\]</span> Now, as a brief aside, let’s recall the following vector calculus identity between a scalar field <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and a vector field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\nabla (f \mathbf{F}) = \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{F} + f \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \ .
\]</span> Rearranging terms and integrating over some volume <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{V}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ f \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} &amp;= \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \nabla (f \mathbf{F}) - \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{F} \\
&amp;= \oint_\mathcal{S} f \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{a} - \int_\mathcal{V} d^3\mathbf{x} \ \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{F} \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> In the last line we used the fundamental theorem of vector calculus to rewrite the volume integral over <span class="math inline">\(\nabla (f \mathbf{F})\)</span> as an integral over <span class="math inline">\(f \mathbf{F}\)</span> evaluated at the volume’s surface <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>. Now, if we send the volume to infinity, we can neglect the surface term so long as <span class="math inline">\(f\mathbf{F}\)</span> vanishes at infinity faster than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{r^2}\)</span>. This means if integrating over all space we’d simply have <span class="math display">\[
\int d^3\mathbf{x} \ f \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = - \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{F} \ .
\]</span> Let’s now apply this result to our integral form for the potential energy <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{U}\)</span>. Using the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} = -\nabla\phi\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{U} = - \frac{1}{8\pi} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \nabla \phi \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{8\pi} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{E} \ .
\]</span> Note that this will only be true if the boundary term vanishes. We can be sure this is true so long as the charge distribution is localized, since in that case we expect <span class="math inline">\(\phi \mathbf{E} \sim \frac{1}{r^3}\)</span>. It may <em>not</em> be true, however, for charge distributions that extend to infinity, in which case we’d have to be more careful with ignoring boundary term. Of course, such cases aren’t <em>really</em> physical anyway.</p>
<p>At any rate, we’ve derived the following interesting result, which says the potential energy stored in the source charge distribution depends only on the square of the electric field, <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{8\pi} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ |\mathbf{E}|^2
}\ .
\]</span> This is why we can think of the potential energy <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{U}\)</span> as the energy stored in the field. That’s all it depends on. It’ll be useful to give the integrand a name. It’s called the <em>energy density</em> <span class="math inline">\(u(\mathbf{x})\)</span>. It’s the potential energy per unit volume stored in the electric field, <span class="math display">\[
u(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \frac{1}{8\pi} |\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})|^2 \ .
\]</span> We’ll find the idea of energy density perhaps most useful in electrodynamics, where we’ll need to modify the above result to also account for magnetic field effects as well.</p>
<p>Note that neither the field energy nor the energy density satisfy the principle of superposition since they’re quadratic in the field, not linear. For example, the energy density due to two fields <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}'\)</span> would be given by <span class="math display">\[
u = \frac{1}{8\pi} |\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{E}'|^2 = \frac{1}{8\pi}|\mathbf{E}|^2 + \frac{1}{8\pi}|\mathbf{E}'|^2 + \frac{1}{8\pi}\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{E}' \ .
\]</span> Last, it’s worth pointing out a very important but subtle issue that arises in going from <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{2} \int d^3 \mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi(\mathbf{x}) \ \rightarrow \ \frac{1}{8\pi} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ |\mathbf{E}|^2 \ .
\]</span> The problem is that of <em>self energy</em>. According to Coulomb’s Law, a charge does not exert a force on itself. It only exerts a force on other charges. However, the second formula includes forces that a charge exerts on itself. To see why, consider the example of a point charge <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> centered at the origin. According to the second formula, we have <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{U} = \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \frac{1}{8\pi} |\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})|^2 = \int_0^\infty 4\pi r^2 dr \ \frac{1}{8\pi} \bigg(\frac{q}{r^2}\bigg)^2 = \infty \ .
\]</span> However, if we use the first formula we get <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x}) \phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^\infty 4\pi r^2 dr \ q \delta(\mathbf{x}) \frac{q}{r} = 0 \ .
\]</span> As we’ve defined the potential energy it’s the latter that should be correct. There’s no potential energy stored in a single point charge since no work was required to bring it in from infinity and place it at the origin. So what’s going on?</p>
<p>We made a subtle error of sorts when we transitioned from a sum over discrete charges to an integral over a charge distribution. Recall that in the sum version we used <span class="math inline">\(j \neq i\)</span> to enforce the requirement that a charge couldn’t affect itself. When we moved to the integral form though this distinction got lost. It turns out that this issue only affects the second formula though. In fact, it only affects distributions of <em>point charges</em>. For continuous distributions the formulas will generally agree.</p>
<p>This doesn’t necessarily mean, however, that the second formula is not <em>correct</em>. It’s just counting something that the first formula isn’t. Namely, it’s also counting the energy required to <em>create</em> the charges, not just assemble them in place. The first formula only counts the energy to assemble the charges, not create them. In this sense they’re both correct, they just mean slightly different things. Indeed, the second formula ties in with the question of whether empty space has energy, the so-called <em>vacuum energy</em>. This topic is a major issue in quantum electrodynamics. In classical dynamics we ignore this distinction, but we do occasionally have to be careful when subtleties like this arise.</p>
<section id="example-field-energy-of-a-hollow-sphere" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-field-energy-of-a-hollow-sphere">Example: Field energy of a hollow sphere</h4>
<p>Recall that the uniformly charged hollow sphere with radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> has an electric field given by <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{Q}{r^2} \ \mathbf{e}_r \ ,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Q = 4\pi R^2 \sigma\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(r \geq R\)</span> and zero otherwise. Thus, according to the second formula for the field energy we have <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{8\pi}\int d^3\mathbf{x} \ |\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x})|^2 = \frac{1}{8\pi}\int_R^\infty 4\pi r^2 dr \ \bigg(\frac{Q}{r^2}\bigg)^2 = \frac{Q^2}{2R} \ .
\]</span> Since this isn’t a point charge, we should expect to get the same result with the first formula as well. Since this is a 2-dimensional distribution we need to replace <span class="math inline">\(\int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \rho(\mathbf{x})\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\int \sigma(\mathbf{x}) \ da\)</span>. At the surface of the sphere we have <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{Q}{R} \ .

\mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{2} \int \sigma(\mathbf{x}) \phi(\mathbf{x}) \ da = \frac{1}{2} \int \sigma \frac{Q}{R} \ da = \frac{Q}{2R} 4\pi R^2 \sigma = \frac{Q^2}{2R} \ .
\]</span> As we can see, the two results agree as expected.</p>

<section id="conductors-and-capacitance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conductors-and-capacitance">Conductors and Capacitance</h2>
<p>Electromagnetic materials can often be thought of one of two types: <em>conductors</em> and <em>insulators</em>. Both are just materials composed of almost all neutral atoms, and hence charge neutral. They differ in one subtle way. Unlike insulators, conductors have a small fraction of <em>unbound electrons</em> that are unbound to their nuclei and free to move around the material, causing the material to <em>conduct</em> in the presence of an external field by moving its unbound electrons around. Insulators don’t have these unbound electrons. The only way an insulator can respond to an external field is by distorting its electron clouds. We’ll talk more about insulators in a future chapter. For now we’ll just focus on conductors, which are a bit easier to understand macroscopically.</p>
<section id="conductors" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conductors">Conductors</h3>
<p>Suppose we have a conductor with some given charge distribution. We place that conductor in the presence of an external electric field and wait for the system to come to electrostatic equilibrium. Once this happens, the electric field becomes time independent, and hence electrostatic. When this happens, the unbound electrons will move in the direction of the external field, creating an internal field inside the conductor of the same strength as the external field, but in opposite direction. The net result is that once the conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, the net electric field will vanish. Thus, conductors will have the property that the electric field is zero inside the conductor.</p>
<p>In fact, if there is no electric field inside the conductor it must be the case that all the unbound electrons will reside on the surface of the conductor. Indeed, this follows immediately from Gauss’s Law. If there is no internal electric field in the conductor, then any Gaussian surface chosen inside the conductor must have <span class="math inline">\(\rho = 0\)</span>​. Thus, the only place left for the charge to go is on the surface, where it will distribute itself such that the internal field vanishes.</p>
<p>This also implies that the surface of a conductor must be an <em>equipotential surface</em>. Since the internal field is zero, we must have <span class="math display">\[
\phi(\mathbf{b}) - \phi(\mathbf{a}) = -\int_\mathbf{a}^\mathbf{b} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = 0
\]</span> for any two points <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{b}\)</span> on the surface of the conductor, meaning <span class="math inline">\(\phi(\mathbf{a}) = \phi(\mathbf{b})\)</span> is constant on the surface. Since the surface of the conductor is an equipotential, this also means that the field lines at the surface must be perpendicular to the surface, since <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi\)</span>​ and we know that gradients are perpendicular to their equipotential surfaces.</p>

<p>We’ll find it convenient to express these results as a set of boundary conditions for conductors.

Since the field inside the conductor is zero, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}_- = \mathbf{0}\)</span>. Thus, just outside the surface we must have <span class="math display">\[
\mathbf{E}_+ = 4\pi\sigma \mathbf{n} \ ,
\]</span> or, in terms of the normal derivative of the potential, we must have <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial n} = -4\pi\sigma \ .
\]</span> This gives us a way to find the surface charge on a conductor if we know the potential, something we’ll find useful in the next chapter.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="capacitance">Capacitance</h3>
<p>When discussing conductors it’s typical to also discuss their <em>capacitance</em>, or ability to store charge. A conductor with this property is often called a <em>capacitor</em>. Suppose we have some conductor with charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and potential <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> relative to some ground point. Since its electric field must be proportional to <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, so must the potential. This means we can write <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
Q = CV
} \ ,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is some proportionality constant, called the <em>capacitance</em> or <em>self capacitance</em>. This means we can also think of the capacitance as the amount of charge stored in a conductor held at unit potential.</p>
<p>The capacitance incapsulates all the geometric information encoded in the conductor needed to relate its charge to its potential. In Gaussian units this is obvious, since by dimensional analysis the capacitance must evidently carry units of <em>length</em>, or <em>centimeters</em>. In SI units, capacitance has units of Volts per Coulomb, called the <em>Farad</em>, with <span class="math inline">\(1 \ \text{F} \approx 9 \cdot 10^{11} \ \text{cm}\)</span>. An implication of this is that a Farad is a very large unit of capacitance. In laboratory settings, most capacitors have capacitances in the range of <span class="math inline">\(10^{-12}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(10^{-6}\)</span> Farads.</p>
<p>As a quick example, let’s consider a conducting sphere of radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and total charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Since the potential inside the sphere is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{Q}{R}\)</span>, we can easily see that <span class="math inline">\(C = R\)</span>, meaning the capacitance of a conducting sphere is just its radius.</p>
<p>In practice, it’s more common to talk about the capacitance between multiple conductors, usually two conductors. The combined set of conductors becomes the capacitor in this case. Suppose we have two conductors of opposite charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span> with a potential difference <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> between them. We again define the capacitance, or <em>mutual capacitance</em>, by the formula <span class="math inline">\(Q = CV\)</span>.</p>
<p>The classic example of a capacitor involving two conductors is two parallel conducting plates with area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and opposite charges <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span> separated by a distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. If we neglect the boundary of the plates by assuming <span class="math inline">\(A \gg d^2\)</span>, their electric field strengths are approximately <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbf{E}| \approx 2\pi\sigma\)</span>. By superposition, the combined field will have a strength of <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbf{E}| = 4\pi\sigma\)</span> between the plates and zero outside the plates. This means the potential difference between the plates must be <span class="math inline">\(V = 4\pi\sigma d\)</span>.</p>
<p>FIGURE</p>
<p>Since the charges themselves must relate to <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> via the formula <span class="math inline">\(Q = \sigma A\)</span>, we must have <span class="math display">\[
Q = \sigma A = 4\pi\sigma d C = CV \ ,
\]</span> which means the capacitance between the two plates is given by <span class="math display">\[
C = \frac{A}{4\pi d} \ .
\]</span> Notice how the capacitance again captures the geometric properties of the conductors, namely the area of the sheets and the distance between them.</p>
<p>Capacitors like the previous example are popular ways to store charge inside of electric circuits. The higher the capacitance, the more charge we say a capacitor can store at a given voltage. The capacitors used in practice usually aren’t parallel plates, but more complex designs like overlapping cylinders, but the same idea holds.</p>
<p>We can also derive a formula for the energy stored in a capacitor. We’ll focus on a single conductor, though the same results easily carry over to multiple conductors as well. Consider again a single conductor with total charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and potential <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. We’ve already shown that the energy stored in this conductor must be <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{2} QV\)</span>. Using the fact that <span class="math inline">\(Q = CV\)</span>, we get <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\mathcal{U} = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
}\ .
\]</span> Thus, the energy stored in a capacitor is proportional to the capacitance and the square of the potential. A capacitor that can store more charge also stores more energy. Unlike, say batteries, however, capacitors can only store energy while they’re actively charged. If the capacitor discharges, for example by turning off its voltage source, it almost instantly dissipates all its energy.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-capacitance-between-two-charged-cylinders">Example: Capacitance between two charged cylinders</h4>
<p>Suppose we have oppositely charged cylinders, one inside the other. The inner cylinder has a radius <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and a charge <span class="math inline">\(-Q\)</span>, while the outer cylinder has a radius <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and a charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>.</p>

<section id="mutual-capacitance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mutual-capacitance">Mutual Capacitance</h3>
<p>Though less common, we can define the mutual capacitance between any number of conductors, not just two. Suppose we have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> conductors with charges <span class="math inline">\(Q_i\)</span> and potentials <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> relative to some ground. We can then write <span class="math display">\[
Q_i = \sum_{i=1}^n C_{i j} V_j \ .
\]</span> Here each coefficient <span class="math inline">\(C_{ij}\)</span> is called the <em>mutual capacitance</em> between conductor <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and conductor <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can relate the capacitance defined between two oppositely charged conductors with the previous definition by setting <span class="math inline">\(Q_1 = Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q_2 = -Q\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(V = V_2 - V_1\)</span> to relate <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> with the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(C_{ij}\)</span>. It’s not hard to see that we get <span class="math display">\[
C = \frac{C_{11} V_1 + C_{12} V_2}{V_2 - V_1} = -\frac{C_{12} V_1 + C_{22} V_2}{V_2 - V_1} \ .
\]</span> We don’t tend to use mutual capacitance as much in practice, nor will we see it again in this course.</p>
