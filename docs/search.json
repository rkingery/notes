Position, velocity, and acceleration are vectors as well. The proportionality constant between \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is called the mass. Loosely speaking, the mass of an object is a measure of its inertia or resistance to motion.\nThe functional form of the forces themselves depend on the particular type of forces applied. Some common forces are:\n\nGravitational Force: \\(\\mathbf{F} = -\\frac{GMm}{r^2} \\mathbf{e}_r\\)\nCoulomb Force: \\(\\mathbf{F} = k_e \\frac{Qq}{r^2} \\mathbf{e}_r\\)\nHarmonic Oscillator: \\(\\mathbf{F} = -k\\mathbf{x}\\)\nLorentz Force: \\(\\mathbf{F} = q\\mathbf{E} + \\frac{q}{c}\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\)\nThrust: \\(\\mathbf{F} = - v_{ex} \\dot m \\mathbf{e}_v\\)\nNormal Force: \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{N}\\)\nTension Force: \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{T}\\)\nFrictional Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = -\\mu |\\mathbf{N}| \\mathbf{e}_v\\)\nDrag Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = -f(\\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{e}_v \\approx -a\\mathbf{v} -b\\mathbf{v}^2\\mathbf{e}_v\\)\nCentrifugal Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = m\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times (\\mathbf{r} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\)\nCoriolis Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = 2m \\mathbf{v} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\)\nBuoyant Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = - \\rho_{liq} V_{sub} \\mathbf{g}\\)"

    "section": "Conservation Laws",
    "text": "Conservation Laws\nA quantity Q is said to be conserved if its time derivative is zero, \\(\\dot Q = 0\\). That is, Q is conserved it it’s constant in time.\n\nMomentum\nFor an object moving at velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), define its linear momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) by \\[\\mathbf{p} = m \\mathbf{v}.\\]\nIf the mass \\(m\\) is constant, we evidently have \\[\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{\\dot p}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{p}=const\\), hence momentum is conserved if there are no forces applied. This is the conservation of momentum.\n\n\nAngular Momentum\nDefine the angular momentum \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) of an object by \\[\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{p}.\\]\nAlso, define the torque \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) by \\[\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F}.\\]\nNote both angular momentum and torque depend on the choices of origin since the position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) depends on choice of origin. Now, observe that \\[\\mathbf{\\dot L} = \\mathbf{\\dot r} \\times \\mathbf{p} + \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{\\dot p} = m \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{N}.\\]\nThus, \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{\\dot L}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{0}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{L}=const\\), hence angular momentum must be conserved if there are no torques applied. This is the conservation of angular momentum.\n\n\nWork and Energy\nDefine the work done on an object as it moves along a path \\(\\gamma\\) from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) by \\[W = \\int_A^B \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{x}.\\]\nIn general, work depends on the path taken to get from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), hence it isn’t a unique property of the system. Now, observe that \\[dW = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} dt = d\\big(\\frac{1}{2}m\\mathbf{v}^2 \\big).\\]\nDefine the kinetic energy of the system by \\(T = \\frac{1}{2} m \\mathbf{v}^2\\). Then we evidently have \\(dW=dT\\). That is, the work done on the system to get from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) via \\(\\gamma\\) is just the change in kinetic energy between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\[W = \\Delta T = T_B - T_A.\\]\nWhen the work done is independent of the path taken it’s a state function of the kinetic energy. In this case, the force \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is said to be conservative.\nBy the Helmholtz theorem, the following conditions are all equivalent:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is conservative,\n\\(W\\) is path-independent,\n\\(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}\\),\nThere is a scalar potential \\(V\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla V\\).\n\nThe scalar potential \\(V\\) is called the potential energy of the system. Evidently, if \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is conservative, we have \\[W = \\int_A^B \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{x} = -\\int_A^B \\nabla V \\cdot d\\mathbf{x} = -\\int_A^B dV = V_A - V_B = -\\Delta V = \\Delta T.\\]\nThat is, \\(\\Delta T + \\Delta V = 0\\). Define the total mechanical energy \\(E\\) of the system by \\[E = T + V.\\]\nThen \\(\\Delta E = \\Delta (T + V) = 0\\). That is, energy is conserved when the forces on the system are conservative. This is the conservation of energy.\nEnergy isn’t generally conserved if the forces aren’t conservative. Examples of non-conservative forces include any force that’s a function of velocity. These include dissipative forces like friction or drag, as well as magnetic forces."
