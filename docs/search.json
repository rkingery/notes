    "text": "Newton’s Laws\nNewton’s Laws efficiently encapsulate the fundamental physics of classical mechanics. They’re stated below specifically for a point particle, or body, but can be extended to more complex systems as well.\n\nA body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless acted upon by a force. That is,\n\n\\[\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0} \\Rightarrow \\mathbf{v}=const.\\]\n\nWhen a body is acted upon by a force, the time rate of change of its acceleration is proportional to the force. That is,\n\n\\[\\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a}.\\]\n\nIf two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions. That is,\n\n\\[\\mathbf{F}_{12} = \\mathbf{F}_{21}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nForces are vectors, which means they obey the superposition principle, and can be analyzed in components. Position, velocity, and acceleration are vectors as well. The proportionality constant between \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is called the mass \\(m\\). Loosely speaking, the mass of an object is a measure of its inertia or resistance to motion.\nThe functional form of the forces themselves depend on the particular type of forces applied. Some common forces are:\n\nGravitational Force: \\(\\mathbf{F} = -\\frac{GMm}{r^2} \\mathbf{e}_r\\)\nCoulomb Force: \\(\\mathbf{F} = k_e \\frac{Qq}{r^2} \\mathbf{e}_r\\)\nHarmonic Oscillator: \\(\\mathbf{F} = -k\\mathbf{x}\\)\nLorentz Force: \\(\\mathbf{F} = q\\mathbf{E} + \\frac{q}{c}\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\)\nThrust: \\(\\mathbf{F} = - |\\mathbf{v}_{ex}| \\dot m \\mathbf{e}_v\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{N}\\)\nTension Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{T}\\)\nFrictional Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = -\\mu |\\mathbf{N}| \\mathbf{e}_v\\)\nDrag Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = -f(\\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{e}_v \\approx -a\\mathbf{v} -b|\\mathbf{v}|^2\\mathbf{e}_v\\)\nCentrifugal Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = m\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times (\\mathbf{x} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\)\nCoriolis Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = 2m \\mathbf{v} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\)\nBuoyant Forces: \\(\\mathbf{F} = - \\rho_{liq} V_{sub} \\mathbf{g}\\)"

    "text": "Conservation Laws\nA quantity Q is said to be conserved if its time derivative is zero, \\(\\dot Q = 0\\). That is, Q is conserved it it’s constant in time.\n\nMomentum\nFor an object moving at velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), define its linear momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) by\n\\[\\mathbf{p} = m \\mathbf{v}.\\]\nIf the mass \\(m\\) is constant, we evidently have\n\\[\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{\\dot p}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{p}=const\\), hence momentum is conserved if there are no forces applied. This is the conservation of momentum.\n\n\nAngular Momentum\nDefine the angular momentum \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) of an object by\n\\[\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{p}.\\]\nSimilarly, define the torque or moment \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) by \\[\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{F}.\\]\nNote both angular momentum and torque depend on the choice of coordinate system used since the position vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) depends on choice of origin. Now, observe that\n\\[\\mathbf{\\dot L} = \\mathbf{\\dot x} \\times \\mathbf{p} + \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{\\dot p} = m \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{N}.\\]\nThus, \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{\\dot L}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{0}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{L}=const\\), hence angular momentum must be conserved if there are no torques applied. This is the conservation of angular momentum.\n\n\nWork and Energy\nDefine the work done on an object as it moves along a path \\(\\gamma\\) from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) by\n\\[W = \\int_A^B \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{x}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, work depends on the path taken to get from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), hence it isn’t a unique property of the system.\nObserve that \\[dW = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} dt = d\\bigg(\\frac{1}{2}m\\mathbf{v}^2 \\bigg).\\] Define the kinetic energy of the system by \\(T = \\frac{1}{2} m \\mathbf{v}^2\\). Then we evidently have \\(dW=dT\\). That is, the work done on the system to get from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) via \\(\\gamma\\) is just the change in kinetic energy between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\n\\[W = \\Delta T = T_B - T_A.\\]\nWhen the work done is independent of the path taken it’s a state function of the kinetic energy. In this case, the force \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is said to be conservative.\nBy the Helmholtz theorem, the following conditions are all equivalent:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is conservative,\n\\(W\\) is path-independent,\n\\(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}\\),\nThere is a scalar potential \\(V=V(\\mathbf{x})\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla V\\).\n\nThe scalar potential \\(V\\) is called the potential energy of the system. Evidently, if \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is conservative, we have\n\\[W = \\int_A^B \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{x} = -\\int_A^B \\nabla V \\cdot d\\mathbf{x} = -\\int_A^B dV = V_A - V_B = -\\Delta V = \\Delta T.\\]\nThat is, \\(\\Delta T + \\Delta V = 0\\). Define the total mechanical energy \\(E\\) of the system by\n\\[E = T + V.\\]\nThen \\(\\Delta E = \\Delta (T + V) = 0\\). That is, energy is conserved when the forces on the system are conservative. This is the conservation of energy.\nEnergy isn’t generally conserved if the forces aren’t conservative. Examples of non-conservative forces include any force that’s a function of velocity. These include dissipative forces like friction or drag, as well as magnetic forces."

    "section": "Examples",
    "text": "Examples\nThe primary goal of mechanics is to understand how systems evolve with time. To understand a particle’s given trajectory in Newtonian Mechanics, we need to\n\nWrite down all the forces acting on the particle,\nUse \\(\\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a}\\) to set up the equations of motion,\nSolve the equations of motion for the trajectory \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\), either analytically or (usually) numerically.\n\nHere are some examples.\n\nExample: Projectile motion\nSuppose a cannon is launched from the origin at an angle \\(\\theta\\) above the ground with initial velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite down the equations of motion. Assume drag is negligible.\nThe forces are \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{g} = -g\\mathbf{e}_y\\). Then, \\[\\mathbf{a} = \\ddot x\\mathbf{e}_x + \\ddot y\\mathbf{e}_y = -g\\mathbf{e}_y\\] \\[\\Longrightarrow    \\ddot x = 0, \\ \\ \\ddot y = -mg.\\]\nFind the trajectory \\(\\mathbf{x}(t) = x(t)\\mathbf{e}_x + y(t)\\mathbf{e}_y\\).\nIntegrating each element twice gives \\[x(t) = x_0 + v_{0x}t = v_0t \\cos \\theta,\\] \\[y(t) = y_0 + v_{0y}t - \\frac{1}{2} gt^2 = v_{0}t\\sin \\theta - \\frac{1}{2} gt^2.\\]\nFind the range, i.e. the value \\(R=x(T)\\) when the cannon hits the ground. Which launch angle maximizes the range?\nFirst, we need to find the time \\(T\\) when \\(y(T) = 0\\). Setting \\[y(T) = 0 = v_0 T \\sin \\theta - \\frac{1}{2} gT^2 \\Longrightarrow T = 0, \\frac{2v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g}.\\] The \\(T=0\\) case is trivial. Plugging the other one in to \\(x(T)\\) finally gives the range, \\[R = x(T) = v_0T \\cos \\theta = \\frac{2v_0^2 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\cos \\theta = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g}.\\]\nNote that the range is maximized when \\(\\sin 2 \\theta = 1\\), which is when the launch angle is \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\).\nFind the shape of the motion \\(y = y(x)\\).\nWe need to eliminate \\(t\\) in both equations and solve for \\(y=y(x(t))\\). Solving \\(x(t)\\) for \\(t\\) gives, \\[x = v_0 t\\cos \\theta \\Longrightarrow t = \\frac{x}{v_0 \\cos \\theta}.\\] Plugging this into \\(y\\) then gives \\[y = v_{0}\\frac{x}{v_0 \\cos \\theta}\\sin \\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g\\bigg(\\frac{x}{v_0 \\cos \\theta}\\bigg)^2 =  \\tan \\theta \\cdot x - \\frac{g}{2v_0^2 \\cos^2 \\theta} x^2.\\] This is a downward sloping parabola with vertex at \\(\\big(\\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{2g}, \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}{g}\\big)\\).\nFind any conserved quantities.\n\nMomentum: Since \\(\\mathbf{F} \\neq \\mathbf{0}\\), momentum isn’t conserved. However, \\(p_x\\) is conserved.\nAngular Momentum: Since \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{x} \\times m\\mathbf{g} \\neq 0\\), angular momentum is not conserved.\nEnergy: Since \\(V=mgy\\), the force \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is conservative, hence energy is conserved.\n\n\n\n\nExample: Block sliding on a ramp with friction\nA block of mass \\(m\\) is sliding down a ramp inclined from the horizontal at an angle \\(\\theta\\). Assume the system has a coefficient of friction \\(\\mu\\), and that the block starts from rest at the top of the ramp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite down the equations of motion.\nChoose a coordinate system such that \\(x\\) is pointing downwards parallel to the ramp and \\(y\\) is pointing outwards perpendicular to the ramp. There are three forces acting, gravity, the normal force, and the frictional force, so \\[\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{N} + m\\mathbf{g} - \\mu \\mathbf{N} \\mathbf{e}_v = N\\mathbf{e}_y + mg(\\sin\\theta\\mathbf{e}_x - \\cos\\theta\\mathbf{e}_y) - \\mu N \\mathbf{e}_x.\\] Resolving into components, we have\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nm \\ddot x &= mg\\sin\\theta - \\mu N, \\\\\nm \\ddot y &= N - mg\\cos\\theta = 0.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe second equation follows from the assumption that the block is constrained to stay on the ramp.\nFind the trajectory \\(\\mathbf{x}(t) = x(t)\\mathbf{e}_x + y(t)\\mathbf{e}_y\\).\nTo solve, we need to eliminate the normal force \\(N\\). Using the EOM for \\(\\ddot y\\), we get \\(N = mg\\cos\\theta\\). Plugging this into the equation for \\(\\ddot x\\) then gives\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\ddot x &= g(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta) = const, \\\\\n\\ddot y &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSuppose the block starts at the top of the ramp, which we’ll call the origin. Then integrating, we get,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx(t) &= v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2}g(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta)t^2, \\\\\ny(t) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNotice \\(x(t)\\) is just the equation of an object falling under a modified gravity \\(\\mathbf{g}'=-g(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta)\\mathbf{e}_x\\).\nFind the angle \\(\\theta\\) at which the block will start sliding.\nThe block will move if \\(\\ddot x \\geq 0\\), i.e. when \\(\\mu \\leq \\tan\\theta\\). It will start moving at the angle when \\(\\tan\\theta=\\mu\\) exactly, i.e. when \\[\\theta = \\arctan\\mu.\\]\nFind any conserved quantities.\n\nMomentum: Since \\(\\mathbf{F} \\neq \\mathbf{0}\\), momentum is not conserved. However, \\(p_y\\) is conserved.\nAngular momentum: Since \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{F} \\neq \\mathbf{0}\\), angular momentum is not conserved.\nEnergy: Since friction is present, \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is a dissipative force, hence it’s not conservative, and energy is not conserved.\n\nFind the rate of energy dissipation as the block slides down the ramp.\nFriction dissipates as a heat \\(Q\\). If the block slides a distance \\(L\\), this means \\(E(0) = E(L) + Q\\). Since the block starts from rest, \\(E(0) = 0\\). At \\(x=L\\), the work done is \\[W = \\int_0^L F_x dx = \\int_0^L mg(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta)dx = mgL(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta) = T(L) - 0 = T(L),\\] so the energy when the block gets to the bottom is \\[E(L) = T(L) + V(L,0) = mgL(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta) - mgL\\sin\\theta = -\\mu mgL\\cos\\theta.\\] Finally, using this to solve for \\(Q\\), the heat dissipated over the entire trajectory, we get \\[Q = E(0) - E(L) = \\mu mgL\\cos\\theta.\\] The most important sanity check here is to notice there’s no heat dissipation if there is no friction."

    "section": "Many-Particle Systems",
    "text": "Many-Particle Systems\nThus far we’ve worked with single-particle systems. Let’s now consider a system of \\(N\\) particles with positions \\(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_N\\) respectively. We can use the principle of superposition to extend the laws derived above for single particles.\nFor \\(N\\)-particle systems it’s convenient to characterize the system’s position using the center of mass vector \\(\\mathbf{R}\\),\n\\[\\mathbf{R} \\equiv \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \\mathbf{x}_i,\\]\nwhere \\(M\\) is just the total mass of the system, \\(M \\equiv \\sum_i m_i\\). The center of mass is just the mass-weighted average of all the particle position vectors.\nSuppose an external force \\(\\mathbf{F}^{ext}\\) is acting on the system, and suppose each particle \\(i\\) imparts a force \\(\\mathbf{F}_{ij}\\) on particle \\(j \\neq i\\). Here’s what this would look like for \\(N=3\\) particles.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy superposition, the total force acting on the entire system is thus,\n\\[\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{F}^{ext} + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mathbf{F}_{ij} = \\sum m_i \\mathbf{a}_i = M\\mathbf{\\ddot R}.\\]\nNow, by Newton’s third law, \\(\\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\\mathbf{F}_{ji}\\). This means all the internal forces cancel in pairs, so we have\n\\[\\mathbf{F}^{ext} = M\\mathbf{\\ddot R}.\\]\nThat is, the system as a whole moves as if it were a point mass \\(M\\) with an external force \\(\\mathbf{F}^{ext}\\) acting on its center of mass \\(\\mathbf{R}\\).\nIf the total momentum is defined as \\(\\mathbf{P} = M \\mathbf{\\dot R}\\), this expression then says \\(\\mathbf{F}^{ext} = \\mathbf{\\dot P}\\). Thus, if no external forces act on the system, then its total linear momentum \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is conserved.\nLet’s now consider the total torques on the system. Suppose the system experiences an external torque \\(\\mathbf{N}^{ext}\\), and that each particle \\(i\\) exerts a torque \\(\\mathbf{N}_{ij}\\) on particle \\(j\\). Then by superposition, the total torque on the system is\n\\[\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext} + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mathbf{N}_{ij} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext} + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mathbf{x}_i \\times \\mathbf{F}_{ij},\\]\nAgain, we can use the fact that each \\(\\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\\mathbf{F}_{ji}\\). If we do this, we can re-write the total torque as\n\\[\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext} + \\sum_{i<j} (\\mathbf{x}_{i}-\\mathbf{x}_{j}) \\times \\mathbf{F}_{ij} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext}.\\]\nNow, if we further assume that each internal force acts centrally, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{F}_{ij} = \\mathbf{F}_{ij}(\\mathbf{x}_{i}-\\mathbf{x}_{j})\\), then the internal cross products all vanish, and we just get \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext}\\). That is, if all the internal forces are central, then the total torque on the system is just the external torque.\nIf the total angular momentum on the system is defined as \\(\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{P}\\), this expression says \\(\\mathbf{\\dot L} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext}\\). Thus, if no external torques act on the system, then its total angular momentum \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is conserved.\nIt’s insightful to separate each particle’s motion vectors explicitly into a center of mass component and a relative component,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{x}_i &= \\mathbf{R} + \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i, \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_i &= \\mathbf{V} + \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s re-write the total angular momentum \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) in terms of these vectors,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{L} &= \\sum \\mathbf{x}_i \\times \\mathbf{p}_i = \\sum (\\mathbf{R} + \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i) \\times m_i(\\mathbf{V} + \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i) \\\\\n&= M\\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{V} + \\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i \\times \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i + \\mathbf{R} \\times \\bigg(\\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i \\bigg) + \\bigg(\\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i \\bigg)\\times \\mathbf{V} \\\\\n&= \\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{P} + \\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i \\times \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i \\\\\n&\\equiv \\mathbf{L}^{orb} + \\mathbf{L}^{spin}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe’ve thus been able to separate the angular momentum into two components, an orbital angular momentum \\(\\mathbf{L}^{orb} = \\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{P}\\), and a spin angular momentum \\(\\mathbf{L}^{spin} = \\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i \\times \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i\\). The orbital angular momentum describes how the center of mass of the object tends to rotate about some external point. The spin angular momentum describes how the system itself tends to rotate about its center of mass.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, let’s look at the total energies of the system. For a system with \\(N\\) particles, the potential energy will be a function of all the position vectors, \\(V = V(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_N)\\). It won’t generally simplify. But the kinetic energy we can simplify. Writing it in terms of its relative and center of mass velocities, we have\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nT &= \\frac{1}{2}\\sum m_i \\mathbf{v}_i^2 = \\sum m_i (\\mathbf{V} + \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i)^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}M\\mathbf{V}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum m_i\\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i^2 + \\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\bigg(\\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i\\bigg) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}M\\mathbf{V}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum m_i\\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i^2 \\\\\n&= T^{CM} + T^{rel}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThus, the kinetic energy separates into a sum of the kinetic energy on the center of mass \\(T^{CM} = \\frac{1}{2}M\\mathbf{V}^2\\), and the kinetic energy of the relative components \\(T^{rel} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum m_i\\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i^2\\). Evidently, the total energy is\n\\[E = T + V = T^{CM} + T^{rel} + V(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_N).\\]\nIt’s conserved provided the external force \\(\\mathbf{F}^{ext}\\) is conservative.\n\nExample: Rockets\nSuppose a rocket of mass \\(m_0=m(t) + m_{ex}(t)\\) is moving through free space with no external forces acting on it. It’s expelling fuel for trust at some constant speed \\(v_{ex}\\) with respect to the rocket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the force of thrust on the rocket?\nNo external forces are present, so \\(\\mathbf{F}^{ext} = \\mathbf{0}\\). The internal forces are the thrust of the rocket, and the force of the exhaust. In the frame of the rocket they cancel out, \\(\\mathbf{F}_{th} = \\mathbf{F}_{ex}\\), so we have \\[\\mathbf{F}_{th} = -\\mathbf{F}_{ex} = -\\mathbf{\\dot p}_{ex} = -\\frac{d}{dt}(m_{ex} \\mathbf{v}_{ex}) = -\\dot m_{ex} \\mathbf{v}_{ex}.\\] Now, since \\(m_0 = m + m_{ex}\\), \\(\\dot m = -\\dot m_{ex}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{ex} = -v_{ex}\\mathbf{e}_v\\), we have \\[\\mathbf{F}_{th} = -\\dot m v_{ex} \\mathbf{e}_v.\\]\nFind the velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}(t)\\) of the rocket.\nUsing the fact that \\(\\mathbf{F}_{th} = m\\mathbf{a}\\), we have \\(-\\dot m v_{ex} = m \\dot v\\), which is just a first-order differential equation in \\(v(t)\\), \\[\\dot v + v_{ex} \\frac{\\dot m}{m} = 0.\\] Integrating both sides and solving for \\(v(t)\\), we get \\[v(t) = v_0 - v_{ex} \\int_{m_0}^m \\frac{dm}{m} = -v_{ex} \\log \\frac{m(t)}{m_0}.\\] Or, expressing in the form of the well-known rocket equation, \\[\\Delta v = v_{ex} \\log\\frac{m_0}{m(t)}.\\]\nFind the position \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\) of the rocket, assuming fuel is expelled form the rocket at a constant rate.\nAssume \\(\\dot m = -k = const\\). Since there are no external forces, the rocket must be traveling along some line. Suppose without loss of generality then that \\(\\mathbf{x}(t) = z(t)\\mathbf{e}_z\\). Then we have,\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nz(t) &= \\int_0^t v(t) dt = v_{ex} \\int_0^t dt \\log\\frac{m_0}{m_0-kt} \\\\\n&= v_ex\\bigg[t - \\bigg(\\frac{m_0-kt}{k} \\bigg) \\log \\bigg(\\frac{m_0}{m_0-kt} \\bigg) \\bigg] \\\\\n&= v_{ex} t - \\frac{v_{ex}}{k}(m_0 - kt)\\log\\bigg(\\frac{m_0}{m_0-kt} \\bigg).\n\\end{align*}\\]"

    "text": "The Lumped Circuit Abstraction\nTo easily and reliably analyze circuits we make a number of simplifying assumptions, or abstractions. By restricting ourselves to situations where these abstractions hold, we set up a simpler playground in which to work.\nThe most fundamental abstraction in circuit analysis is the lumped circuit abstraction or LCA. In the LCA, we assume a circuit is made of a set of lumped elements that are connected to each other with ideal wires (i.e. wires with no voltage drop across any two points and a uniform current throughout).\nAs an example, let’s consider a lightbulb connected to a battery supplying a voltage \\(v\\), which causes a current \\(i\\) to flow across the bulb from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’d like to solve for the current \\(i\\) as a function of the input voltage \\(v\\). How should we do this? The hard way would be to just use Maxwell’s Equations. But this is unnecessary.\nNotice that we don’t care about many of the physical properties of the circuit, including the bulb’s shape, temperature, filament design, or what the wires are made of. We only care about the bulb’s resistance, since Ohm’s law says \\(v=iR\\). We can thus abstract the details of the bulb and the battery away, treating the bulb as a resistor and the battery as a voltage source.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we’ve done this, we can simply solve for the current in terms of the voltage simply as \\[i = \\frac{v}{R}.\\]\nA more abstract way to express this simple circuit is to use special symbols for the resistor and the voltage source. We’d write the exact same setup like this.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, how do we know we can do this? How do we even know that \\(v\\) and \\(i\\) are even defined? After all, neither voltage nor current need exist in a well-defined way. However, under certain conditions, they do exist. Consider the following setup, where a current \\(i\\) flows through a wire from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). The voltage across the wire is \\(v\\). The cross-sectional areas through \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are \\(s_A\\) and \\(s_B\\), respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the continuity equation, we have \\[i_A - i_B \\equiv \\int_{s_A} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{a} - \\int_{s_B} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t}.\\] Provided no charge can build up inside the wire, we have \\[\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t} = 0 \\Rightarrow i_A = i_B \\equiv i.\\] That is, we have a well-defined current \\(i\\) flowing through the wire provided we forbid a buildup of charge inside the wire.\nBy Faraday’s Law, we also have \\[v_A - v_B \\equiv \\int_A^B \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{\\ell} = -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_M}{\\partial t}.\\] Provided magnetic flux is constant outside the wires, we can conclude \\[\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_M}{\\partial t} = 0 \\Rightarrow v_A = v_b \\equiv v.\\] That is, we have a well-defined voltage \\(v\\) across the wire provided we forbid any change in magnetic flux outside the wire.\nThe last condition we must require is that currents move much slower than the speed of light. This says that currents aren’t allowed to radiate.\nThe requirement that circuits obey each of these properties is called the lumped matter discipline:\n\nElements are discrete and independent of each other.\nNo charge can build up inside of wires.\nMagnetic flux is constant outside of the circuit.\nCurrents must move much slower than the speed of light."

    "text": "Curvilinear Coordinates\nFor many problems, it’s more convenient to take advantage of the underlying symmetry by using special coordinate systems. Other than rectangular coordinates \\((x,y,z)\\), the most common coordinate systems worth being familiar with are polar coordinates \\((r,\\varphi)\\), cylindrical coordinates \\((\\rho,\\varphi,z)\\), and spherical coordinates \\((r,\\theta,\\varphi)\\).\n\nPolar Coordinates\nFor problems with circular symmetry it’s convenient to use polar coordinates \\((r,\\varphi)\\), defined by\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx &=  r\\cos\\varphi, \\\\\ny &=  r\\sin\\varphi. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(r \\geq 0\\) and \\(0 \\leq \\varphi \\leq 2\\pi\\). We can assign basis vectors to polar coordinates \\(\\mathbf{e}_r, \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi\\) to each point as usual.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing to keep in mind is that these curvilinear basis vectors are now functions of position,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{e}_r &= \\mathbf{e}_r(r, \\varphi), \\\\\n\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi &= \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi(r, \\varphi).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can figure out how these basis vectors change by taking their differentials, which follow from the figure above,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nd\\mathbf{e}_r &= \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi d\\varphi, \\\\\nd\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi &= -\\mathbf{e}_r d\\varphi.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nUsing these differential forms, we can conclude that the motion vectors change as follows,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{x} &= r\\mathbf{e}_r, \\\\\n\\mathbf{v} &= \\dot r \\mathbf{e}_r + r\\dot \\varphi \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi, \\\\\n\\mathbf{a} &= (\\ddot r - r\\dot \\varphi^2)\\mathbf{e}_r + (2\\dot r \\dot \\varphi + r\\ddot \\varphi)\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nExample: Circular orbits\nSuppose an object moves in a circular orbit of radius \\(r\\) at a constant angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) due to a central force \\(\\mathbf{F} = -F\\mathbf{e}_r\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the equations of motion. Since the object moves at constant \\(\\omega\\), we have \\(\\dot \\varphi = \\omega = const\\). Using the polar equations for velocity and acceleration, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{v} &= \\dot r \\mathbf{e}_r, \\\\\n\\mathbf{a} &= -r\\omega^2\\mathbf{e}_r + r \\dot \\omega\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi = - \\frac{F}{m}\\mathbf{e}_r.\n\\end{align*}\\] Note we can re-write these equations to get \\(F = m\\omega^2 r\\).\nFind the period \\(\\tau\\) of the orbit.\nWe want the time it takes for \\(\\Delta \\varphi = 2\\pi\\). Since \\(\\Delta \\varphi = \\omega\\tau\\), solving for \\(\\tau\\) gives \\[\\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}.\\]\nSuppose the central force is the gravitational force, \\(F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\). Find the angular velocity, the period, and the orbital velocity as a function of \\(G, M, r\\).\nWe have \\[F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} = m\\omega^2 r \\ \\Longrightarrow \\ \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r^3}} \\ \\Longrightarrow \\ \\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{GM}} r^{3/2}.\\] This is just a special case of Kepler’s third law, \\(\\tau^2 \\propto r^3\\). The orbital velocity is given by \\[v = r\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}.\\]\n\n\n\nExample: Simple pendulum\nConsider the problem of the simple pendulum, where a mass \\(m\\) swings on a massless string of length \\(\\ell\\) under the force of gravity. The string is fixed at one point. Assume no damping is present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the equations of motion from the forces directly.\nThere are two forces in this problem, gravity and the tension in the string, \\[\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{T} + m\\mathbf{g} = -T\\mathbf{e}_r + mg(\\cos\\theta \\mathbf{e}_r - \\sin\\theta\\mathbf{e}_\\theta).\\] Dividing by \\(m\\) and setting equal to the polar form of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), we have \\[\\mathbf{a} = (-T+mg\\cos\\theta)\\mathbf{e}_r - mg\\sin\\theta\\mathbf{e}_\\theta = -m\\ell^2 \\dot \\theta^2 \\mathbf{e}_r + m\\ell^2 \\ddot \\theta \\mathbf{e}_\\theta.\\] This gives two equations of motion, one for the tension and one for the angular acceleration, \\[\\begin{align*}\nT &= m\\ell^2 \\dot\\theta^2 + mg\\cos\\theta, \\\\\n\\ddot \\theta &= -\\frac{g}{\\ell} \\sin\\theta. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFind the equations of motion again, but this time using torques.\nRecall \\(\\mathbf{N} = I \\boldsymbol{\\dot \\omega}\\), where \\(I\\) is the scalar moment of inertia and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\) is the angular velocity vector. In this case, \\(I=m\\ell^2\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\dot \\omega} = \\ddot \\theta \\mathbf{e}_z\\). Then we have \\[I \\boldsymbol{\\dot \\omega} = m\\ell^2 \\ddot \\theta \\mathbf{e}_z \\equiv \\ell\\mathbf{e}_r \\times m\\mathbf{g} = -mg\\ell\\sin\\theta \\mathbf{e}_z = \\mathbf{N},\\] which can be solve to get \\(\\ddot \\theta = -\\frac{g}{\\ell}\\sin\\theta\\). Notice how in this approach we don’t need to worry about the tension at all.\nSuppose \\(\\theta\\) is small. Write down the equations of motion, solve them, and find the period.\nWhen \\(\\theta \\ll 1\\) the small angle approximation applies, \\(\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta\\). In this case, the equation of motion reduces to \\[\\ddot \\theta = -\\frac{g}{\\ell} \\theta,\\] which is just simple harmonic oscillation with angular frequency \\(\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{\\ell}}\\). The solution to SHO is \\[\\theta(t) = A\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi),\\] where \\(A\\) is some amplitude and \\(\\phi\\) is some phase determined by the initial conditions. Finally, solving for the period, we have \\[\\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ell}{g}}.\\]\n\n\n\nCylindrical Coordinates\nCylindrical coordinates extend polar coodinates by adding in the z-axis from the rectangular system,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx &=  r\\cos\\varphi, \\\\\ny &=  r\\sin\\varphi, \\\\\nz &= z.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe basis vectors are \\(\\mathbf{e}_r, \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi, \\mathbf{e}_z\\). Their differential forms are just \\[\\begin{align*}\nd\\mathbf{e}_r &= \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi d\\varphi, \\\\\nd\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi &= -\\mathbf{e}_r d\\varphi \\\\\nd\\mathbf{e}_z &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\\] The motion vectors in cylindrical coordinates are thus given by, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{x} &= r\\mathbf{e}_r, \\\\\n\\mathbf{v} &= \\dot r \\mathbf{e}_r + r\\dot \\varphi \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi + \\dot z \\mathbf{e}_z , \\\\\n\\mathbf{a} &= (\\ddot r - r\\dot \\varphi^2)\\mathbf{e}_r + (2\\dot r \\dot \\varphi + r\\ddot \\varphi)\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi + \\ddot z \\mathbf{e}_z.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nSpherical Coordinates\nSpherical coordinates extend polar coordinates in a slightly different way. The radius \\(r\\) is now 3-dimensional, and there are two angles, a polar angle \\(0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi\\) and an azimuthal angle \\(0 \\leq \\varphi \\leq 2\\pi\\). The conversion to rectangular coordinates is given by, \\[\\begin{align*}\nx &=  r\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi, \\\\\ny &=  r\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi, \\\\\nz &= r\\cos\\theta. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe basis vectors are \\(\\mathbf{e}_r, \\mathbf{e}_\\theta, \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi\\). Deriving the differential forms of these is a good bit more complex. Here they are,\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nd\\mathbf{e}_r &= \\dot\\theta \\sin\\varphi d\\mathbf{e}_\\theta + \\dot\\varphi d\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi, \\\\\nd\\mathbf{e}_\\theta &= - \\dot\\theta \\sin\\varphi d\\mathbf{e}_r - \\dot\\theta \\cos\\varphi d\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi, \\\\\nd\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi &= - \\dot\\varphi \\mathbf{e}_r + \\dot\\theta \\cos\\varphi \\mathbf{e}_\\theta. \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThese can then be used to get the motion vectors in spherical coordinates,\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{r} &= r \\mathbf{e}_r, \\\\\n\\mathbf{v} &= \\dot{r} \\mathbf{e}_r\n+ r \\dot\\theta \\sin\\varphi \\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}\n+ r \\dot\\varphi \\mathbf{e}_{\\varphi}, \\\\\n\\mathbf{a} &= (\\ddot{r} - r \\dot{\\theta}^2 \\sin^2\\varphi\n- r \\dot{\\varphi}^2) \\mathbf{e}_r \\\\\n&\\quad + (r \\ddot\\theta \\sin\\varphi\n+ 2 \\dot{r} \\dot\\theta \\sin\\varphi\n+ 2 r \\dot\\theta \\dot\\varphi \\cos\\varphi) \\mathbf{e}_{\\theta} \\\\\n&\\quad + (r \\ddot\\varphi + 2 \\dot{r} \\dot\\varphi\n- r \\dot{\\theta}^2 \\sin\\varphi \\cos\\varphi) \\mathbf{e}_{\\varphi}.\n\\end{aligned}\\]"

    "text": "Drag Forces\nThe next type of forces we’ll consider are those which are functions of velocity,\n\\[\nm\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{v}).\n\\] In the 1-dimensional case, this reduces to,\n\\[\nma = F(v).\n\\] Provided \\(v\\) is small, we can approximate \\(F(v)\\) by its first few terms. I’ll write it as,\n\\[\nF(v) \\approx a - bv - cv^2.\n\\] Typically, drag forces shouldn’t apply a force when the particle is at rest, which means \\(a=0\\). The remaining two terms cover two distinct regimes of drag:\n\nLinear or viscous drag: \\(F(v) = -bv\\), where \\(b > 0\\).\nQuadratic or air drag: \\(F(v) = -cv^2\\), where \\(c > 0\\).\n\n\nLinear Drag\nIt’s convenient to analyze these two distinct cases separately. Let’s first look at linear drag. In that case \\(c=0\\), and we end up with the linear differential equation \\[\nm \\ddot x + b \\dot x = 0.\n\\] To solve this equation, re-write it in terms of \\(v = \\dot x\\),\n\\[\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = -\\frac{b}{m} v.\n\\] Integrating both sides, we get\n\\[\nv(t) = v_0 e^{-\\frac{b}{m} t}.\n\\] For \\(x(t)\\) just integrate both sides again to get\n\\[\nx(t) = x_0 + \\int_0^t v_0 e^{-\\frac{b}{m} t'} dt' = x_0 + \\frac{mv_0}{b}\\big(1 - e^{-\\frac{b}{m} t}\\big).\n\\] Evidently, such forces cause a moving particle to slowly come to rest, since \\(v \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\). The position where the particle comes to rest is evidently \\(x_f = x_0 + \\frac{mv_0}{b}\\). The \\(\\frac{1}{e}\\) decay time is \\(\\tau = \\frac{m}{b}\\). This suggests that \\(b\\) functions as a sort of drag coefficient, since a large \\(b\\) causes the system to dissipate faster.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear drag is frequently used to model objects moving through a viscous medium at low speeds. Suppose a spherical object of radius \\(R\\) is moving slowly in a viscous medium with viscosity \\(\\eta\\). Then the drag force on the object is given by Stokes’ Law,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}_d = -6\\pi\\eta R \\mathbf{v}.\n\\] This force is linear in velocity, hence we can write \\(F_d = -6\\pi\\eta R v\\), which says the drag constant \\(b\\) is just\n\\[\nb = 6\\pi\\eta R.\n\\]\n\n\nExample: Dropping a ball in syrup\nSuppose a ball of radius \\(R\\) and mass \\(m\\) is dropped in a viscous syrup from rest at \\(x=0\\). Find the velocity and position of the ball as it moves through the fluid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a 1-dimensional motion problem since the ball is dropped from rest under gravity, with \\(F=F_d + mg\\). Here Stoke’s law applies, so the drag force is \\(F_d = -bv = -b\\dot x\\). Plugging into Newton’s Second Law, we have \\[\nm\\ddot x + b \\dot x = g.\n\\] Re-writing this in terms of \\(v = \\dot x\\), we get \\[\nm \\dot v + bv = g,\n\\] which is a first order linear differential equation for the velocity \\(v(t)\\). Its general solution is given by \\[\nv(t) = v_0 e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t} + \\frac{mg}{b}(1-e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t}).\n\\] Notice that as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), \\(v(t) \\rightarrow \\frac{mg}{b}\\). That is, \\(v(t)\\) tends toward a terminal velocity \\[\nv_t = \\frac{mg}{b} = \\frac{mg}{6\\pi\\eta R}.\n\\] Since the ball is dropped from rest, \\(v_0=0\\). The velocity of the ball is thus given by \\[\nv(t) = v_t(1-e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t}).\n\\] Using this we can solve for the position to get \\[\nx(t) = v_t\\bigg(t - \\frac{b}{m}(1 - e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t})\\bigg).\n\\] Notice that drag causes the ball to fall much slower than it would in free-fall. Instead of being a quadratic function of time, \\(x(t)\\) is now approximately a linear function of time, with \\(x(t) \\sim v_t t\\) for large \\(t\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuadratic Drag\nWe’ll now look at quadratic drag, where \\(b=0\\). Then we get the differential equation, \\[\nm\\ddot x + c \\dot x^2 = 0.\n\\] This is no longer a linear differential equation due to the appearance of \\(\\dot x^2\\), but surprisingly we can still solve it using separation of variables. Again, let \\(v = \\dot x\\). Then we get \\[\nm\\dot v + cv^2 = 0.\n\\] Rearranging and solving for \\(v(t)\\), we have \\[\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = -\\frac{c}{m}v^2 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\n\\int_{v_0}^{v} \\frac{dv}{v^2} = -\\frac{c}{m} t \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\nv(t) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{v_0} + \\frac{c}{m}t}.\n\\] Integrating both sides and solving for the position, we get \\[\nx(t) = x_0 + \\int_0^t \\frac{dt}{\\frac{1}{v_0} + \\frac{c}{m}t} = x_0 + \\frac{m}{c}\\log\\bigg( 1 + \\frac{cv_0}{m}t \\bigg).\n\\] In this case, \\(v \\rightarrow 0\\), but \\(x \\rightarrow \\infty\\) as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\). Evidently, while linear drag is strong enough to slow a moving particle back down to rest, quadratic drag is not.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuadratic drag is often used to model the drag experienced by objects moving through air or other media where pressure is more important than viscosity. For an object moving through air, drag is well-modeled by the drag equation, \\[\n\\mathbf{F}_d = -\\frac{1}{2}C \\rho A v^2 \\mathbf{e}_v,\n\\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the density of air, \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area of the object in the direction of motion, and \\(C\\) is the drag coefficient. Since this force is proportional to \\(v^2\\), we evidently have \\[\nc = \\frac{1}{2}C \\rho A.\n\\]\n\n\nReynold’s Number\nIn practice, how can we tell if drag is in the linear or quadratic situation? A simple way to do this is by looking at the Reynold’s Number. Let’s go back to the full quadratic equation for drag, with \\(a\\) set to \\(0\\), \\[\nF_d = -bv - cv^2.\n\\] Notice that the ratio \\(\\frac{cv}{b}\\) gives the relative importance of the two drag terms. Using Stoke’s Law and the Drag Equation for the drag constants, we can re-write this expression as \\[\n\\frac{cv}{b} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}C \\rho Av}{6\\pi\\eta R} = \\frac{C \\rho Rv}{3\\eta}.\n\\] This ratio is usually rescaled by a factor of \\(\\frac{3}{C}\\) to get the Reynold’s number \\(r\\), \\[\nr = \\frac{\\rho Rv}{\\eta}.\n\\] The Reynold’s number is usually what’s used in practice to decide whether we’re in the linear or quadratic drag regime.\n\nWhen the Reynold’s number is low, \\(r \\ll 1\\), \\(v \\ll \\frac{\\eta}{R\\rho}\\), and we’re in the linear regime.\nWhen the Reynold’s number is high, \\(r \\gg 1\\), \\(v \\gg \\frac{\\eta}{R\\rho}\\), and we’re in the quadratic regime.\nThe edge case is when \\(r \\approx 1\\), or \\(v \\approx \\frac{\\eta}{R\\rho}\\). Then, we have to include both the linear and quadratic drag terms in the equation of motion. In this general case, there’s no analytic solution and we have to solve things numerically.\n\nThe Reynold’s number is usually easy to calculate since we can often at least roughly estimate the object’s velocity and radius, and we can usually look up the medium’s viscosity and density. For example, a baseball thrown in air at 100 mph would have a Reynold’s number of about \\(r \\approx 3 \\cdot 10^5 \\gg 1\\), which is solidly in the quadratic drag regime."

The most convenient abstraction to make is that we can describe the global behavior of an object as if it were a point object with no width. It can’t spin or deform. It’s one indivisible thing. We call these point particles.\nWe’ll think of a point particle as following some trajectory in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\).

In the Newtonian formulation, if we want to find a particle’s trajectory, we start with the particle’s acceleration vector\n\\[\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{\\dot v} = \\mathbf{\\ddot x} = \\frac{d^2\\mathbf{x}}{dt^2},\\]\nand match it with the force vector \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) via Newton’s Second Law to get a second-order differential equation for \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\)."

    "text": "Harmonic Oscillation\nThe next case we’ll consider is when the force is linear in position, \\[\n\\mathbf{F} = -k \\mathbf{x}.\n\\] This relationship is called Hooke’s Law. In the 1-dimensional case, it reduces to the equation of motion \\[\nm \\ddot x + kx = 0.\n\\] This is a second-order linear differential equation for \\(x(t)\\). The general solution to this differential equation depends on the sign of \\(k\\). If \\(k < 0\\), we have \\[\nx(t) = c_1 e^{\\frac{k}{m}t} + c_2 e^{-\\frac{k}{m}t}.\n\\] Since \\(x \\rightarrow \\infty\\) pretty quickly as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), this kind of solution is usually non-physical, except perhaps in situations where \\(x\\) is bounded between some known range.\nThe most important case by far is when \\(k > 0\\). In this setting, it’s typical to define \\(\\omega^2 \\equiv \\frac{k}{m}\\) and re-rewrite the equation as \\[\n\\ddot x + \\omega^2 x = 0.\n\\] This is called the simple harmonic oscillator or SHO. The canonical example of SHO is of course the motion of a mass attached to an ideal spring with spring constant \\(k\\).\nThe general solution to SHO is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, \\[\nx(t) = c_1 \\cos \\omega t + c_2 \\sin \\omega t.\n\\] This trajectory is oscillatory and stable since it only involves sines and cosines, both of which are bounded periodic functions. It’s custom to re-write this equation in a more useful form using trig identities,\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx(t) &= c_1 \\cos \\omega t + c_2 \\sin \\omega t \\\\\n&= A\\bigg(\\frac{c_1}{A}\\cos \\omega t + \\frac{c_2}{A}\\sin\\omega t \\bigg) \\\\\n&= A(\\cos\\delta \\cos \\omega t + \\sin\\delta\\sin\\omega t) \\\\\n&= A\\cos(\\omega t - \\delta). \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIn this form, \\(A\\) is the amplitude of oscillation and \\(\\delta\\) is the phase of oscillation. The period of oscillation is given by \\[\n\\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s usually convenient when dealing with harmonic oscillators to work in the complex plane. Consider the complex form of SHO, given by the differential equation \\[\n\\ddot z + \\omega^2 z = 0,\n\\] where \\(z = x+iy = |z|e^{i\\theta}\\) is a complex variable. Its general solution is given as a linear combination of complex exponentials, \\[\nz(t) = \\tilde c_1 e^{i\\omega t} + \\tilde c_2 e^{-i\\omega t}.\n\\] If we demand that the real solution we seek be given by \\(x(t) = \\text{Re}(z(t))\\), then\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx(t) &= \\Re(c_1 e^{i \\omega t}) + \\Re(c_2 e^{-i \\omega t}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}(c_1 + c_2^*)e^{i \\omega t} + \\frac{1}{2}(c_1^* + c_2)e^{-i \\omega t} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} C e^{i \\omega t} + \\frac{1}{2} C^* e^{-i \\omega t} \\\\\n&= A \\cdot \\Re(e^{i(\\omega t - \\delta)}) \\\\\n&= A \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta),\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(C \\equiv Ae^{i \\delta}\\) is some complex number whose real and imaginary parts are \\(c_1+c_2^*\\) and \\(c_1^*+c_2\\) respectively. For the full complex solution we can similarly write \\[\nz(t) = A e^{i(\\omega t - \\delta)}\n\\] Evidently then, SHO is just a CCW circular rotation in the complex plane with radius \\(A\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Bottle sloshing in a bucket\nSuppose a bottle of mass \\(m\\) floats calmly in a bucket of water of density \\(\\rho\\) at some equilibrium depth of \\(d=d_0\\). Suppose we push down slightly on the bottle, perturbing its depth to \\(d = d_0 + x\\). The bottle will begin to oscillate. Find its period of oscillation \\(\\tau\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forces on the bottle are gravity downward and an opposing buoyant force upward, \\[\nF = mg - \\rho g V_{sub} = mg - \\rho g A(d_0 + x).\n\\] At equilibrium, the forces must balance, so \\(0 = mg - \\rho g A d_0\\), which means \\(d_0 = \\frac{m}{\\rho A}\\) is the equilibrium depth. Simplifying, this says the equation of motion is given by \\[\nm \\ddot x = mg - \\rho g A(d_0 + x) = -\\rho g A x = -\\frac{mg}{d_0} x.\n\\] This is just SHO with spring constant \\(k = \\frac{mg}{d_0}\\), or angular frequency \\(\\omega = \\frac{g}{d}\\). Thus, the period of the bottle’s oscillation when \\(x\\) is small is given by \\[\n\\tau = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\omega} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{d_0}{g}}.\n\\]\n\n\nTwo-Dimensional Harmonic Oscillation\nSuppose now we allow a mass to move in two dimensions. Hooke’s Law becomes\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nm \\ddot x &= -k_x x, \\\\\nm \\ddot y &= -k_y y.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSince the equation of motions are uncoupled, the solutions are simply given by\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx(t) &= A_x \\cos(\\omega_x t - \\delta_x), \\\\\ny(t) &= A_y \\cos(\\omega_y t - \\delta_y).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nDespite what intuition might suggest, the motion of the mass is now quite non-trivial. In fact, the behavior of the trajectory depends entirely on the ratio of the frequencies \\(\\frac{\\omega_x}{\\omega_y}\\) and the relative phase between the two oscillations \\(\\delta = \\delta_x - \\delta_y\\).\nThe motion will only be periodic if \\(\\frac{\\omega_x}{\\omega_y}\\) is rational, i.e. if the frequencies are integer multiples of each other. The curves traced out by \\((x(t), y(t))\\) when \\(\\frac{\\omega_x}{\\omega_y}\\) is rational are called Lissajous curves. They can get quite complicated, but they’ll always be periodic. Here’s what a few of them look like for different\\(\\frac{\\omega_x}{\\omega_y}\\) and \\(\\delta\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Charged particle in a uniform magnetic field\nSuppose a particle with charge \\(q\\) and mass \\(m\\) is moving in the presence of a constant magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). Find its equations of motion, solve for the trajectory, and describe what it looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the velocity of the particle, the magnetic force is given by \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{q}{c} \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\). Suppose \\(\\mathbf{B} = B \\mathbf{e}_z\\). Then \\[\n\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{q}{c}\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{qB}{c}(\\dot y \\mathbf{e}_x - \\dot x \\mathbf{e}_y),\n\\] The equations of motion are thus\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nm \\ddot x &= \\frac{qB}{c} \\dot y , \\\\\nm \\ddot y &= -\\frac{qB}{c} \\dot x , \\\\\nm \\ddot z &=  0. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nDefine \\(\\omega \\equiv \\frac{qB}{c}\\). The first two equations can be decoupled to give two independent SHO equations in the velocities,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\ddot v_x &= -\\omega^2 v_x , \\\\\n\\ddot v_y &= -\\omega^2 v_y , \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwith solutions\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nv_x(t) &= V_x \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta_x) , \\\\\nv_y(t) &= V_y \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta_y)  , \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow, since \\(\\ddot v_x = \\omega \\dot v_y\\), we must have \\(V_x = V_y\\) and \\(\\delta_y = \\delta_x - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Taking \\(\\delta_x=0\\) and \\(V_x = R\\omega\\) for convenience, we get\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nv_x(t) &= R\\omega \\cos(\\omega t) , \\\\\nv_y(t) &= -R\\omega \\sin(\\omega t)  , \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFinally, integrating the velocity equations gives the trajectory,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx(t) &=  x_0 + R \\sin(\\omega t), \\\\\ny(t) &= (y_0 - R) + R \\cos(\\omega t) , \\\\\nz(t) &=  z_0 + v_{0z} t. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis is just a helix of radius \\(R\\) directed along the z-axis. That is, the particle will just spiral around in a helix directed along the line of the magnetic field. The frequency \\(\\omega\\) is called the cyclotron frequency. Since charge can be positive or negative, it carries a sign, which determines which way the particle will spiral. Notice that \\(R\\) is just the radius of orbit. It’s customarily expressed in terms of the tangential velocity \\(v_\\perp = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = R\\omega\\), \\[\nR = \\frac{mcv_\\perp}{qB}.\n\\]"

Then we can write the DHO equation of motion as \\[\n\\ddot x + 2\\beta x + \\omega_0^2 x = 0.\n\\] It’ll be insightful to solve this in its complex form. Consider instead the equation \\[\n\\ddot z + 2\\beta z + \\omega_0^2 z = 0,\n\\] where \\(z\\) is complex-valued. Let’s try and assume a trial solution of the form \\(z = A e^{i\\omega t - \\delta}\\).

We can re-write \\(\\omega'\\) in terms of the Q-factor as \\[\n\\omega' = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\bigg(\\frac{1}{2Q}\\bigg)^2}.\n\\] Evidently, the form of the solutions divide into three cases depending on the sign of \\(\\omega'\\):\n\nUnderdamping (\\(\\omega' > 0\\) or \\(Q < \\frac{1}{2}\\)): In this case, \\(\\omega'\\) is real, which means we have a real solution \\[\nx(t) = A e^{-\\beta t} \\cos(\\omega't - \\delta).\n\\] This is an exponentially damped sinusoidal oscillation, where \\(x \\rightarrow 0\\) with time constant \\(\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\). Notice \\(\\omega' < \\omega_0\\), which means the actual frequency of the oscillation is less than the natural frequency. When \\(Q \\gg 1\\) this distinction disappears, since \\(\\omega' \\approx \\omega_0\\). In practice this occurs frequently for underdamped solutions, and \\(Q\\) need not even be large for \\(\\omega' \\approx \\omega_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nOverdamping (\\(\\omega' < 0\\) or \\(Q > \\frac{1}{2}\\)): In this case, \\(\\omega'\\) is complex.

There are several ways to find a particular solution, including guessing methods and more systematic methods like Green functions and Fourier transforms. We’ll briefly touch on some of these.\n\nExample: Underdamped hanging spring\nSuppose a spring is suspended vertically from a ceiling under the presence of gravity. Find the position \\(x=x(t)\\). Also, find the amount that gravity changes the spring’s equilibrium length.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forces in this problem are gravity, linear drag, and a spring force, so if \\(x\\) points downward, \\[\nF = mg - bv - kx.\n\\] The equation of motion is thus given by \\[\nm \\ddot x + b \\dot x + kx = mg.\n\\] This is just DDHO with \\(f(t) = g\\).

This occurs at \\(x = \\frac{gm}{k}\\) relative to the free equilibrium \\(x=0\\).\n\n\nResonance\nThe most interesting driving forces in practice are ones that are periodic. Periodic driving functions lead to the important concept of resonance, which is a phenomenon that occurs when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency.\nConsider a driving force of the form \\(f(t) = f_0 \\cos\\omega t\\). In complex form, we can then write \\[\n\\ddot z + 2\\beta\\dot z + \\omega_0^2 z = f_0 e^{i \\omega t}.\n\\] Assume a particular solution of the form \\(z(t) = \\tilde A e^{i \\omega t}\\) where \\(\\tilde A = Ae^{-i\\delta}\\). Plugging this in, we have \\[\n(-\\omega^2 + 2\\beta\\omega i + \\omega_0^2)\\tilde A e^{-i\\omega t} = f_0 e^{i\\omega t},\n\\] which we can solve for the complex amplitude \\(\\tilde A\\) to get \\[\n\\tilde A = \\frac{f_0}{(\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2) + 2\\beta\\omega i}.\n\\] With the help of little trig, we can decompose this solution to get the real amplitude and phase,\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{f_0}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2)^2 + 4\\beta^2\\omega^2}}, \\quad \\delta = \\tan^{-1} \\frac{2\\beta\\omega}{\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2}.\n\\]\nWith these, the real particular solution is given by \\(x_p(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta)\\). Since the homogenous solution decays to zero exponentially, \\(x \\rightarrow x_p\\) as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\). That is, \\(x_p(t)\\) describes the steady state solution of the DDHO. In this sense, the system evidently “forgets” its own natural frequency and starts to oscillate at the driving frequency as time goes on and the transient state dies off.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the memory of the transient system are preserved in the amplitude and phase. As a rule of thumb, the number of oscillations \\(N\\) until \\(x \\approx x_p\\) is basically just the Q-factor, \\[\nN \\approx \\frac{Q}{2\\pi}.\n\\] Let’s now look more deeply at the amplitude and phase. It’s worth asking how they depend on the external driving frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\nWhen \\(\\omega \\ll \\omega_0\\), \\(A \\approx \\frac{f_0}{\\omega_0^2}\\) and \\(\\delta \\approx 0\\).\nWhen \\(\\omega \\gg \\omega_0\\), \\(A \\approx 0\\) and \\(\\delta \\approx \\pi\\).\nWhen \\(\\omega \\approx \\omega_0\\), \\(A \\approx \\frac{f_0}{2\\beta\\omega_0}\\) and \\(\\delta \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidently, \\(A\\) is maximized at \\(\\omega_R = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2-2\\beta^2} = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{2Q^2}}\\). When \\(Q>1\\), \\(\\omega_R \\approx \\omega_0\\), so this distinction doesn’t really matter. This frequency \\(\\omega_R \\approx \\omega_0\\) is called the resonance frequency of the system. When the driver is operating near the resonance frequency, the system responds extremely well to the driving force. It turns out that when a spectrum of frequencies is dumped on an oscillating system, the system tends to pick out the resonance frequencies and respond to those. This fact makes resonance a very important topic in physics and engineering.\nIn practice, high-Q systems are very common. In those cases, \\(A\\) dies off quickly when the driving frequencies aren’t close to \\(\\omega_0\\). That means practically all the interesting behavior of a high-Q systems is in the band around the resonance frequency. Suppose \\(\\Delta \\equiv \\omega - \\omega_0\\) is small. Then we can write \\[\n(\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2) = (\\omega_0-\\omega)(\\omega_0+\\omega) = -\\Delta(2\\omega_0+\\Delta) \\approx -2\\omega_0 \\Delta.\n\\] That means we can write the complex amplitude \\(\\tilde A\\) as \\[\n\\tilde A = \\frac{f_0}{(\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2) + 2\\beta\\omega i} \\approx -\\frac{\\frac{f_0}{2\\omega_0}}{\\Delta-\\beta i} = \\frac{f_0}{2\\omega_0}\\bigg(-\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Delta^2+\\beta^2} + i\\frac{\\beta}{\\Delta^2+\\beta^2} \\bigg).\n\\] This function on the right is called the Lorentzian. Using this, we can see \\[\nA \\approx \\frac{f_0}{2\\omega_0} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + \\beta^2}} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad A^2 \\approx \\bigg(\\frac{f_0}{2\\omega_0}\\bigg)^2 \\frac{1}{\\Delta^2 + \\beta^2}.\n\\] Since the energy in a harmonic oscillator is just \\(E = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 \\propto A^2\\), it’s common to look at plots of \\(A^2\\) when plotting these resonance curves. Evidently, \\(A^2 \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(\\Delta \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and it’s maximized when \\(\\Delta = 0\\), which is when \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\) and \\(A_{max}^2 = \\big(\\frac{f_0}{2\\omega_0 \\beta}\\big)^2\\).\nIt’s common to measure the width of the resonance curve by using the full width at half maximum or FWHM. The FWHM is defined as the difference between the left and right points around the maximum whose height is half the maximum, \\[\nFWHM \\equiv \\Delta \\omega \\equiv \\omega_R - \\omega_L, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad A^2(\\omega_L) = A^2(\\omega_R) = \\frac{1}{2}A_{max}.\n\\] Solving for these left and right points gives \\(\\omega_L = \\omega_0 - \\beta\\) and \\(\\omega_R = \\omega_0 + \\beta\\), so \\[\n\\Delta \\omega = (\\omega_0 + \\beta) - (\\omega_0 - \\beta) = 2\\beta.\n\\] The relative width of the resonance curve is then \\[\n\\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{\\omega_0} = \\frac{2\\beta}{\\omega_0} = \\frac{1}{Q}.\n\\] This indicates the resolving power of the resonance curve. Evidently, \\(Q\\) represents the signal-to-noise ratio of the curve. The higher the Q-factor is, the more sharply peaked the resonance curve is, and the easier we can pinpoint the resonant frequency exactly. Indeed, this is why \\(Q\\) is called a quality factor."

Plugging this in, we have \\[\n(-\\omega^2 + 2\\beta\\omega i + \\omega_0^2)\\tilde A e^{-i\\omega t} = f_0 e^{i\\omega t},\n\\] which we can solve for the complex amplitude \\(\\tilde A\\) to get \\[\n\\tilde A = \\frac{f_0}{(\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2) + 2\\beta\\omega i}.\n\\] With the help of little trig, we can decompose this solution to get the real amplitude and phase,\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{f_0}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2)^2 + 4\\beta^2\\omega^2}}, \\quad \\delta = \\tan^{-1} \\frac{2\\beta\\omega}{\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2}.\n\\]\nWith these, the real particular solution is given by \\(x_p(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta)\\). Since the homogenous solution decays to zero exponentially, \\(x \\rightarrow x_p\\) as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\). That is, \\(x_p(t)\\) describes the steady state solution of the DDHO. In this sense, the system evidently “forgets” its own natural frequency and starts to oscillate at the driving frequency as time goes on and the transient state dies off.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the memory of the transient system are preserved in the amplitude and phase. As a rule of thumb, the number of oscillations \\(N\\) until \\(x \\approx x_p\\) is basically just the Q-factor, \\[\nN \\approx \\frac{Q}{2\\pi}.\n\\] Let’s now look more deeply at the amplitude and phase. It’s worth asking how they depend on the external driving frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\nWhen \\(\\omega \\ll \\omega_0\\), \\(A \\approx \\frac{f_0}{\\omega_0^2}\\) and \\(\\delta \\approx 0\\).\nWhen \\(\\omega \\gg \\omega_0\\), \\(A \\approx 0\\) and \\(\\delta \\approx \\pi\\).\nWhen \\(\\omega \\approx \\omega_0\\), \\(A \\approx \\frac{f_0}{2\\beta\\omega_0}\\) and \\(\\delta \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidently, \\(A\\) is maximized at \\(\\omega_R = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2-2\\beta^2} = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{2Q^2}}\\). When \\(Q>1\\), \\(\\omega_R \\approx \\omega_0\\), so this distinction doesn’t really matter. This frequency \\(\\omega_R \\approx \\omega_0\\) is called the resonance frequency of the system. When the driver is operating near the resonance frequency, the system responds extremely well to the driving force. It turns out that when a spectrum of frequencies is dumped on an oscillating system, the system tends to pick out the resonance frequencies and respond to those. This fact makes resonance a very important topic in physics and engineering.\nIn practice, high-Q systems are very common. In those cases, \\(A\\) dies off quickly when the driving frequencies aren’t close to \\(\\omega_0\\). That means practically all the interesting behavior of a high-Q systems is in the band around the resonance frequency. Suppose \\(\\Delta \\equiv \\omega - \\omega_0\\) is small. Then we can write \\[\n(\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2) = (\\omega_0-\\omega)(\\omega_0+\\omega) = -\\Delta(2\\omega_0+\\Delta) \\approx -2\\omega_0 \\Delta.\n\\] That means we can write the complex amplitude \\(\\tilde A\\) as \\[\n\\tilde A = \\frac{f_0}{(\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2) + 2\\beta\\omega i} \\approx -\\frac{\\frac{f_0}{2\\omega_0}}{\\Delta-\\beta i} = \\frac{f_0}{2\\omega_0}\\bigg(-\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Delta^2+\\beta^2} + i\\frac{\\beta}{\\Delta^2+\\beta^2} \\bigg).\n\\] This function on the right is called the Lorentzian. Using this, we can see \\[\nA \\approx \\frac{f_0}{2\\omega_0} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + \\beta^2}} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad A^2 \\approx \\bigg(\\frac{f_0}{2\\omega_0}\\bigg)^2 \\frac{1}{\\Delta^2 + \\beta^2}.\n\\] Since the energy in a harmonic oscillator is just \\(E = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 \\propto A^2\\), it’s common to look at plots of \\(A^2\\) when plotting these resonance curves. Evidently, \\(A^2 \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(\\Delta \\rightarrow \\infty\\), and it’s maximized when \\(\\Delta = 0\\), which is when \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\) and \\(A_{max}^2 = \\big(\\frac{f_0}{2\\omega_0 \\beta}\\big)^2\\).\nIt’s common to measure the width of the resonance curve by using the full width at half maximum or FWHM. The FWHM is defined as the difference between the left and right points around the maximum whose height is half the maximum, \\[\nFWHM \\equiv \\Delta \\omega \\equiv \\omega_R - \\omega_L, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad A^2(\\omega_L) = A^2(\\omega_R) = \\frac{1}{2}A_{max}.\n\\] Solving for these left and right points gives \\(\\omega_L = \\omega_0 - \\beta\\) and \\(\\omega_R = \\omega_0 + \\beta\\), so \\[\n\\Delta \\omega = (\\omega_0 + \\beta) - (\\omega_0 - \\beta) = 2\\beta.\n\\] The relative width of the resonance curve is then \\[\n\\frac{\\Delta \\omega}{\\omega_0} = \\frac{2\\beta}{\\omega_0} = \\frac{1}{Q}.\n\\] This indicates the resolving power of the resonance curve. Evidently, \\(Q\\) represents the signal-to-noise ratio of the curve. The higher the Q-factor is, the more sharply peaked the resonance curve is, and the easier we can pinpoint the resonant frequency exactly. Indeed, this is why \\(Q\\) is called a quality factor."

    "text": "Driven Damped Harmonic Oscillation\nLet’s now add in the independent force term to the mix. In the 1-dimensional case, we get the equation of motion \\[\nm \\ddot x + b \\dot x + kx = F_0(t).\n\\] This is called the driven damped harmonic oscillator or DDHO. We imagine \\(F_0(t)\\) to be some external driving force acting on the system. It’s again convenient to rewrite things by defining \\(\\beta = \\frac{b}{2m}\\), \\(\\omega_0^2 = \\frac{k}{m}\\), and \\(f(t) = \\frac{F_0(t)}{m}\\). Then we have the linear differential equation \\[\n\\ddot x + 2\\beta\\dot x + \\omega_0^2 x = f(t).\n\\] Recall that the solutions of linear differential equations can be decomposed into two pieces, a homogenous solution and a particular solution. The homogenous solution is the general solution to \\[\n\\ddot x_h + 2\\beta\\dot x_h + \\omega_0^2 x_h = 0.\n\\] But this is just a DHO. We solved that part already. All we need to do now is find any particular solution that will solve \\[\n\\ddot x_p + 2\\beta\\dot x_p + \\omega_0^2 x_p = f(t).\n\\] Provided we do that, the full, general solution will be \\(x(t) = x_h(t) + x_p(t)\\). There are several ways to find a particular solution, including guessing methods and more systematic methods like Green functions and Fourier transforms. We’ll briefly touch on some of these.\n\nExample: Underdamped hanging spring\nSuppose a spring is suspended vertically from a ceiling under the presence of gravity. Find the position \\(x=x(t)\\). Also, find the amount that gravity changes the spring’s equilibrium length.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forces in this problem are gravity, linear drag, and a spring force, so if \\(x\\) points downward, \\[\nF = mg - bv - kx.\n\\] The equation of motion is thus given by \\[\nm \\ddot x + b \\dot x + kx = mg.\n\\] This is just DDHO with \\(f(t) = g\\). We thus seek a particular solution \\(x_p(t)\\) such that \\[\n\\ddot x_p + 2\\beta\\dot x_p + \\omega_0^2 x_p = g.\n\\] Assume a trial solution of the form \\(x_p = c\\). Then, \\[\n\\omega_0^2 c = g \\Longrightarrow c = \\frac{g}{\\omega_0^2} = \\frac{gm}{k}.\n\\] Supposing the spring is underdamped, then \\[\nx(t) = Ae^{-\\beta t} \\cos(\\omega' t - \\delta) + \\frac{gm}{k}.\n\\] The new equilibrium occurs when the object is at rest, i.e. when \\(\\ddot x = \\dot x = 0\\). This occurs at \\(x = \\frac{gm}{k}\\) relative to the free equilibrium \\(x=0\\).\n\n\nResonance\nThe most interesting driving forces in practice are ones that are periodic. Periodic driving functions lead to the important concept of resonance, which is a phenomenon that occurs when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency.\nConsider a driving force of the form \\(f(t) = f_0 \\cos\\omega t\\).

Indeed, this is why \\(Q\\) is called a quality factor.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne very important system where we want a high-Q is a clock. To keep precise time, we need to make sure that it’s oscillating pretty much exactly at its resonance frequencies. This is because we need to keep a regular period, so \\(\\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\\) can’t be allowed to vary very much from the true period \\(\\tau_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_0}\\). There’s a tradeoff though. Since the decay time of the transient behavior is \\(N\\tau_0 \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\), it takes about \\(N=\\frac{Q}{\\pi}\\) cycles of ringing for the system to come to steady state. So the better precision we want, the longer we’ll have to wait for the system to come to steady state.\nNote that \\(Q\\) also affects the phase curve of the system, since \\[\n\\delta = \\tan^{-1} \\frac{2\\beta\\omega}{\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2} \\approx \\tan^{-1} \\frac{2\\omega}{Q\\Delta}.\n\\] Evidently as \\(Q\\) increases, the system becomes more responsive to sudden changes in phase around \\(\\omega_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArbitrary Driving Forces"
