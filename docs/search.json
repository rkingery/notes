    "text": "Conservation Laws\nA quantity Q is said to be conserved if its time derivative is zero, \\(\\dot Q = 0\\). That is, Q is conserved it it’s constant in time.\n\nMomentum\nFor an object moving at velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), define its linear momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) by\n\\[\\mathbf{p} = m \\mathbf{v}.\\]\nIf the mass \\(m\\) is constant, we evidently have\n\\[\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{\\dot p}.\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{p}=const\\), hence momentum is conserved if there are no forces applied. This is the conservation of momentum.\n\n\nAngular Momentum\nDefine the angular momentum \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) of an object by\n\\[\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{p}.\\]\nSimilarly, define the torque or moment \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) by \\[\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{F}.\\]\nNote both angular momentum and torque depend on the choice of coordinate system used since the position vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) depends on choice of origin. Now, observe that\n\\[\\mathbf{\\dot L} = \\mathbf{\\dot x} \\times \\mathbf{p} + \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{\\dot p} = m \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{N}.\\]\nThus, \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{\\dot L}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{0}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{L}=const\\), hence angular momentum must be conserved if there are no torques applied. This is the conservation of angular momentum.\n\n\nWork and Energy\nDefine the work done on an object as it moves along a path \\(\\gamma\\) from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) by\n\\[W = \\int_A^B \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{x}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, work depends on the path taken to get from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), hence it isn’t a unique property of the system.\nObserve that \\[dW = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} dt = d\\bigg(\\frac{1}{2}m\\mathbf{v}^2 \\bigg).\\] Define the kinetic energy of the system by \\(T = \\frac{1}{2} m \\mathbf{v}^2\\). Then we evidently have \\(dW=dT\\). That is, the work done on the system to get from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) via \\(\\gamma\\) is just the change in kinetic energy between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\n\\[W = \\Delta T = T_B - T_A.\\]\nWhen the work done is independent of the path taken it’s a state function of the kinetic energy. In this case, the force \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is said to be conservative.\nBy the Helmholtz theorem, the following conditions are all equivalent:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is conservative,\n\\(W\\) is path-independent,\n\\(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}\\),\nThere is a scalar potential \\(V=V(\\mathbf{x})\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla V\\).\n\nThe scalar potential \\(V\\) is called the potential energy of the system. Evidently, if \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is conservative, we have\n\\[W = \\int_A^B \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{x} = -\\int_A^B \\nabla V \\cdot d\\mathbf{x} = -\\int_A^B dV = V_A - V_B = -\\Delta V = \\Delta T.\\]\nThat is, \\(\\Delta T + \\Delta V = 0\\). Define the total mechanical energy \\(E\\) of the system by\n\\[E = T + V.\\]\nThen \\(\\Delta E = \\Delta (T + V) = 0\\). That is, energy is conserved when the forces on the system are conservative. This is the conservation of energy.\nEnergy isn’t generally conserved if the forces aren’t conservative. Examples of non-conservative forces include any force that’s a function of velocity. These include dissipative forces like friction or drag, as well as magnetic forces."

    "text": "Examples\nThe primary goal of mechanics is to understand how systems evolve with time. To understand a particle’s given trajectory in Newtonian Mechanics, we need to\n\nWrite down all the forces acting on the particle,\nUse \\(\\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a}\\) to set up the equations of motion,\nSolve the equations of motion for the trajectory \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\), either analytically or (usually) numerically.\n\nHere are some examples.\n\nExample: Projectile motion\nSuppose a cannon is launched from the origin at an angle \\(\\theta\\) above the ground with initial velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite down the equations of motion. Assume drag is negligible.\nThe forces are \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{g} = -g\\mathbf{e}_y\\). Then, \\[\\mathbf{a} = \\ddot x\\mathbf{e}_x + \\ddot y\\mathbf{e}_y = -g\\mathbf{e}_y\\] \\[\\Longrightarrow    \\ddot x = 0, \\ \\ \\ddot y = -mg.\\]\nFind the trajectory \\(\\mathbf{x}(t) = x(t)\\mathbf{e}_x + y(t)\\mathbf{e}_y\\).\nIntegrating each element twice gives \\[x(t) = x_0 + v_{0x}t = v_0t \\cos \\theta,\\] \\[y(t) = y_0 + v_{0y}t - \\frac{1}{2} gt^2 = v_{0}t\\sin \\theta - \\frac{1}{2} gt^2.\\]\nFind the range, i.e. the value \\(R=x(T)\\) when the cannon hits the ground. Which launch angle maximizes the range?\nFirst, we need to find the time \\(T\\) when \\(y(T) = 0\\). Setting \\[y(T) = 0 = v_0 T \\sin \\theta - \\frac{1}{2} gT^2 \\Longrightarrow T = 0, \\frac{2v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g}.\\] The \\(T=0\\) case is trivial. Plugging the other one in to \\(x(T)\\) finally gives the range, \\[R = x(T) = v_0T \\cos \\theta = \\frac{2v_0^2 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\cos \\theta = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g}.\\]\nNote that the range is maximized when \\(\\sin 2 \\theta = 1\\), which is when the launch angle is \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\).\nFind the shape of the motion \\(y = y(x)\\).\nWe need to eliminate \\(t\\) in both equations and solve for \\(y=y(x(t))\\). Solving \\(x(t)\\) for \\(t\\) gives, \\[x = v_0 t\\cos \\theta \\Longrightarrow t = \\frac{x}{v_0 \\cos \\theta}.\\] Plugging this into \\(y\\) then gives \\[y = v_{0}\\frac{x}{v_0 \\cos \\theta}\\sin \\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g\\bigg(\\frac{x}{v_0 \\cos \\theta}\\bigg)^2 =  \\tan \\theta \\cdot x - \\frac{g}{2v_0^2 \\cos^2 \\theta} x^2.\\] This is a downward sloping parabola with vertex at \\(\\big(\\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{2g}, \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}{g}\\big)\\).\nFind any conserved quantities.\n\nMomentum: Since \\(\\mathbf{F} \\neq \\mathbf{0}\\), momentum isn’t conserved. However, \\(p_x\\) is conserved.\nAngular Momentum: Since \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{x} \\times m\\mathbf{g} \\neq 0\\), angular momentum is not conserved.\nEnergy: Since \\(V=mgy\\), the force \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is conservative, hence energy is conserved.\n\n\n\n\nExample: Block sliding on a ramp with friction\nA block of mass \\(m\\) is sliding down a ramp inclined from the horizontal at an angle \\(\\theta\\). Assume the system has a coefficient of friction \\(\\mu\\), and that the block starts from rest at the top of the ramp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite down the equations of motion.\nChoose a coordinate system such that \\(x\\) is pointing downwards parallel to the ramp and \\(y\\) is pointing outwards perpendicular to the ramp. There are three forces acting, gravity, the normal force, and the frictional force, so \\[\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{N} + m\\mathbf{g} - \\mu \\mathbf{N} \\mathbf{e}_v = N\\mathbf{e}_y + mg(\\sin\\theta\\mathbf{e}_x - \\cos\\theta\\mathbf{e}_y) - \\mu N \\mathbf{e}_x.\\] Resolving into components, we have\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nm \\ddot x &= mg\\sin\\theta - \\mu N, \\\\\nm \\ddot y &= N - mg\\cos\\theta = 0.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe second equation follows from the assumption that the block is constrained to stay on the ramp.\nFind the trajectory \\(\\mathbf{x}(t) = x(t)\\mathbf{e}_x + y(t)\\mathbf{e}_y\\).\nTo solve, we need to eliminate the normal force \\(N\\). Using the EOM for \\(\\ddot y\\), we get \\(N = mg\\cos\\theta\\). Plugging this into the equation for \\(\\ddot x\\) then gives\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\ddot x &= g(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta) = const, \\\\\n\\ddot y &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSuppose the block starts at the top of the ramp, which we’ll call the origin. Then integrating, we get,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx(t) &= v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2}g(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta)t^2, \\\\\ny(t) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNotice \\(x(t)\\) is just the equation of an object falling under a modified gravity \\(\\mathbf{g}'=-g(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta)\\mathbf{e}_x\\).\nFind the angle \\(\\theta\\) at which the block will start sliding.\nThe block will move if \\(\\ddot x \\geq 0\\), i.e. when \\(\\mu \\leq \\tan\\theta\\). It will start moving at the angle when \\(\\tan\\theta=\\mu\\) exactly, i.e. when \\[\\theta = \\arctan\\mu.\\]\nFind any conserved quantities.\n\nMomentum: Since \\(\\mathbf{F} \\neq \\mathbf{0}\\), momentum is not conserved. However, \\(p_y\\) is conserved.\nAngular momentum: Since \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{x} \\times \\mathbf{F} \\neq \\mathbf{0}\\), angular momentum is not conserved.\nEnergy: Since friction is present, \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is a dissipative force, hence it’s not conservative, and energy is not conserved.\n\nFind the rate of energy dissipation as the block slides down the ramp.\nFriction dissipates as a heat \\(Q\\). If the block slides a distance \\(L\\), this means \\(E(0) = E(L) + Q\\). Since the block starts from rest, \\(E(0) = 0\\). At \\(x=L\\), the work done is \\[W = \\int_0^L F_x dx = \\int_0^L mg(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta)dx = mgL(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta) = T(L) - 0 = T(L),\\] so the energy when the block gets to the bottom is \\[E(L) = T(L) + V(L,0) = mgL(\\sin\\theta - \\mu\\cos\\theta) - mgL\\sin\\theta = -\\mu mgL\\cos\\theta.\\] Finally, using this to solve for \\(Q\\), the heat dissipated over the entire trajectory, we get \\[Q = E(0) - E(L) = \\mu mgL\\cos\\theta.\\] The most important sanity check here is to notice there’s no heat dissipation if there is no friction."

    "section": "Many-Particle Systems",
    "text": "Many-Particle Systems\nThus far we’ve worked with single-particle systems. Let’s now consider a system of \\(N\\) particles with positions \\(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_N\\) respectively. We can use the principle of superposition to extend the laws derived above for single particles.\nFor \\(N\\)-particle systems it’s convenient to characterize the system’s position using the center of mass vector \\(\\mathbf{R}\\),\n\\[\\mathbf{R} \\equiv \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^N m_i \\mathbf{x}_i,\\]\nwhere \\(M\\) is just the total mass of the system, \\(M \\equiv \\sum_i m_i\\). The center of mass is just the mass-weighted average of all the particle position vectors.\nSuppose an external force \\(\\mathbf{F}^{ext}\\) is acting on the system, and suppose each particle \\(i\\) imparts a force \\(\\mathbf{F}_{ij}\\) on particle \\(j \\neq i\\). Here’s what this would look like for \\(N=3\\) particles.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy superposition, the total force acting on the entire system is thus,\n\\[\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{F}^{ext} + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mathbf{F}_{ij} = \\sum m_i \\mathbf{a}_i = M\\mathbf{\\ddot R}.\\]\nNow, by Newton’s third law, \\(\\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\\mathbf{F}_{ji}\\). This means all the internal forces cancel in pairs, so we have\n\\[\\mathbf{F}^{ext} = M\\mathbf{\\ddot R}.\\]\nThat is, the system as a whole moves as if it were a point mass \\(M\\) with an external force \\(\\mathbf{F}^{ext}\\) acting on its center of mass \\(\\mathbf{R}\\).\nIf the total momentum is defined as \\(\\mathbf{P} = M \\mathbf{\\dot R}\\), this expression then says \\(\\mathbf{F}^{ext} = \\mathbf{\\dot P}\\). Thus, if no external forces act on the system, then its total linear momentum \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is conserved.\nLet’s now consider the total torques on the system. Suppose the system experiences an external torque \\(\\mathbf{N}^{ext}\\), and that each particle \\(i\\) exerts a torque \\(\\mathbf{N}_{ij}\\) on particle \\(j\\). Then by superposition, the total torque on the system is\n\\[\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext} + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mathbf{N}_{ij} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext} + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mathbf{x}_i \\times \\mathbf{F}_{ij},\\]\nAgain, we can use the fact that each \\(\\mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\\mathbf{F}_{ji}\\). If we do this, we can re-write the total torque as\n\\[\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext} + \\sum_{i<j} (\\mathbf{x}_{i}-\\mathbf{x}_{j}) \\times \\mathbf{F}_{ij} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext}.\\]\nNow, if we further assume that each internal force acts centrally, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{F}_{ij} = \\mathbf{F}_{ij}(\\mathbf{x}_{i}-\\mathbf{x}_{j})\\), then the internal cross products all vanish, and we just get \\(\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext}\\). That is, if all the internal forces are central, then the total torque on the system is just the external torque.\nIf the total angular momentum on the system is defined as \\(\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{P}\\), this expression says \\(\\mathbf{\\dot L} = \\mathbf{N}^{ext}\\). Thus, if no external torques act on the system, then its total angular momentum \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is conserved.\nIt’s insightful to separate each particle’s motion vectors explicitly into a center of mass component and a relative component,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{x}_i &= \\mathbf{R} + \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i, \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_i &= \\mathbf{V} + \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s re-write the total angular momentum \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) in terms of these vectors,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{L} &= \\sum \\mathbf{x}_i \\times \\mathbf{p}_i = \\sum (\\mathbf{R} + \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i) \\times m_i(\\mathbf{V} + \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i) \\\\\n&= M\\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{V} + \\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i \\times \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i + \\mathbf{R} \\times \\bigg(\\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i \\bigg) + \\bigg(\\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i \\bigg)\\times \\mathbf{V} \\\\\n&= \\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{P} + \\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i \\times \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i \\\\\n&\\equiv \\mathbf{L}^{orb} + \\mathbf{L}^{spin}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe’ve thus been able to separate the angular momentum into two components, an orbital angular momentum \\(\\mathbf{L}^{orb} = \\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{P}\\), and a spin angular momentum \\(\\mathbf{L}^{spin} = \\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{r}}_i \\times \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i\\). The orbital angular momentum describes how the center of mass of the object tends to rotate about some external point. The spin angular momentum describes how the system itself tends to rotate about its center of mass.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast, let’s look at the total energies of the system. For a system with \\(N\\) particles, the potential energy will be a function of all the position vectors, \\(V = V(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_N)\\). It won’t generally simplify. But the kinetic energy we can simplify. Writing it in terms of its relative and center of mass velocities, we have\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nT &= \\frac{1}{2}\\sum m_i \\mathbf{v}_i^2 = \\sum m_i (\\mathbf{V} + \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i)^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}M\\mathbf{V}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum m_i\\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i^2 + \\mathbf{V} \\cdot \\bigg(\\sum m_i \\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i\\bigg) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}M\\mathbf{V}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum m_i\\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i^2 \\\\\n&= T^{CM} + T^{rel}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThus, the kinetic energy separates into a sum of the kinetic energy on the center of mass \\(T^{CM} = \\frac{1}{2}M\\mathbf{V}^2\\), and the kinetic energy of the relative components \\(T^{rel} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum m_i\\boldsymbol{\\mathscr{v}}_i^2\\). Evidently, the total energy is\n\\[E = T + V = T^{CM} + T^{rel} + V(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_N).\\]\nIt’s conserved provided the external force \\(\\mathbf{F}^{ext}\\) is conservative.\n\nExample: Rockets\nSuppose a rocket of mass \\(m_0=m(t) + m_{ex}(t)\\) is moving through free space with no external forces acting on it. It’s expelling fuel for trust at some constant speed \\(v_{ex}\\) with respect to the rocket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the force of thrust on the rocket?\nNo external forces are present, so \\(\\mathbf{F}^{ext} = \\mathbf{0}\\). The internal forces are the thrust of the rocket, and the force of the exhaust. In the frame of the rocket they cancel out, \\(\\mathbf{F}_{th} = \\mathbf{F}_{ex}\\), so we have \\[\\mathbf{F}_{th} = -\\mathbf{F}_{ex} = -\\mathbf{\\dot p}_{ex} = -\\frac{d}{dt}(m_{ex} \\mathbf{v}_{ex}) = -\\dot m_{ex} \\mathbf{v}_{ex}.\\] Now, since \\(m_0 = m + m_{ex}\\), \\(\\dot m = -\\dot m_{ex}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{ex} = -v_{ex}\\mathbf{e}_v\\), we have \\[\\mathbf{F}_{th} = -\\dot m v_{ex} \\mathbf{e}_v.\\]\nFind the velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}(t)\\) of the rocket.\nUsing the fact that \\(\\mathbf{F}_{th} = m\\mathbf{a}\\), we have \\(-\\dot m v_{ex} = m \\dot v\\), which is just a first-order differential equation in \\(v(t)\\), \\[\\dot v + v_{ex} \\frac{\\dot m}{m} = 0.\\] Integrating both sides and solving for \\(v(t)\\), we get \\[v(t) = v_0 - v_{ex} \\int_{m_0}^m \\frac{dm}{m} = -v_{ex} \\log \\frac{m(t)}{m_0}.\\] Or, expressing in the form of the well-known rocket equation, \\[\\Delta v = v_{ex} \\log\\frac{m_0}{m(t)}.\\]\nFind the position \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\) of the rocket, assuming fuel is expelled form the rocket at a constant rate.\nAssume \\(\\dot m = -k = const\\). Since there are no external forces, the rocket must be traveling along some line. Suppose without loss of generality then that \\(\\mathbf{x}(t) = z(t)\\mathbf{e}_z\\). Then we have,\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nz(t) &= \\int_0^t v(t) dt = v_{ex} \\int_0^t dt \\log\\frac{m_0}{m_0-kt} \\\\\n&= v_ex\\bigg[t - \\bigg(\\frac{m_0-kt}{k} \\bigg) \\log \\bigg(\\frac{m_0}{m_0-kt} \\bigg) \\bigg] \\\\\n&= v_{ex} t - \\frac{v_{ex}}{k}(m_0 - kt)\\log\\bigg(\\frac{m_0}{m_0-kt} \\bigg).\n\\end{align*}\\]"

    "text": "The Lumped Circuit Abstraction\nTo easily and reliably analyze circuits we make a number of simplifying assumptions, or abstractions. By restricting ourselves to situations where these abstractions hold, we set up a simpler playground in which to work.\nThe most fundamental abstraction in circuit analysis is the lumped circuit abstraction or LCA. In the LCA, we assume a circuit is made of a set of lumped elements that are connected to each other with ideal wires (i.e. wires with no voltage drop across any two points and a uniform current throughout).\nAs an example, let’s consider a lightbulb connected to a battery supplying a voltage \\(v\\), which causes a current \\(i\\) to flow across the bulb from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’d like to solve for the current \\(i\\) as a function of the input voltage \\(v\\). How should we do this? The hard way would be to just use Maxwell’s Equations. But this is unnecessary.\nNotice that we don’t care about many of the physical properties of the circuit, including the bulb’s shape, temperature, filament design, or what the wires are made of. We only care about the bulb’s resistance, since Ohm’s law says \\(v=iR\\). We can thus abstract the details of the bulb and the battery away, treating the bulb as a resistor and the battery as a voltage source.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we’ve done this, we can simply solve for the current in terms of the voltage simply as \\[i = \\frac{v}{R}.\\]\nA more abstract way to express this simple circuit is to use special symbols for the resistor and the voltage source. We’d write the exact same setup like this.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, how do we know we can do this? How do we even know that \\(v\\) and \\(i\\) are even defined? After all, neither voltage nor current need exist in a well-defined way. However, under certain conditions, they do exist. Consider the following setup, where a current \\(i\\) flows through a wire from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). The voltage across the wire is \\(v\\). The cross-sectional areas through \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are \\(s_A\\) and \\(s_B\\), respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the continuity equation, we have \\[i_A - i_B \\equiv \\int_{s_A} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{a} - \\int_{s_B} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot d\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t}.\\] Provided no charge can build up inside the wire, we have \\[\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t} = 0 \\Rightarrow i_A = i_B \\equiv i.\\] That is, we have a well-defined current \\(i\\) flowing through the wire provided we forbid a buildup of charge inside the wire.\nBy Faraday’s Law, we also have \\[v_A - v_B \\equiv \\int_A^B \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{\\ell} = -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_M}{\\partial t}.\\] Provided magnetic flux is constant outside the wires, we can conclude \\[\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_M}{\\partial t} = 0 \\Rightarrow v_A = v_b \\equiv v.\\] That is, we have a well-defined voltage \\(v\\) across the wire provided we forbid any change in magnetic flux outside the wire.\nThe last condition we must require is that currents move much slower than the speed of light. This says that currents aren’t allowed to radiate.\nThe requirement that circuits obey each of these properties is called the lumped matter discipline:\n\nElements are discrete and independent of each other.\nNo charge can build up inside of wires.\nMagnetic flux is constant outside of the circuit.\nCurrents must move much slower than the speed of light."

    "text": "Curvilinear Coordinates\nFor many problems, it’s more convenient to take advantage of the underlying symmetry by using special coordinate systems. Other than rectangular coordinates \\((x,y,z)\\), the most common coordinate systems worth being familiar with are polar coordinates \\((r,\\varphi)\\), cylindrical coordinates \\((\\rho,\\varphi,z)\\), and spherical coordinates \\((r,\\theta,\\varphi)\\).\n\nPolar Coordinates\nFor problems with circular symmetry it’s convenient to use polar coordinates \\((r,\\varphi)\\), defined by\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx &=  r\\cos\\varphi, \\\\\ny &=  r\\sin\\varphi. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(r \\geq 0\\) and \\(0 \\leq \\varphi \\leq 2\\pi\\). We can assign basis vectors to polar coordinates \\(\\mathbf{e}_r, \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi\\) to each point as usual.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing to keep in mind is that these curvilinear basis vectors are now functions of position,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{e}_r &= \\mathbf{e}_r(r, \\varphi), \\\\\n\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi &= \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi(r, \\varphi).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can figure out how these basis vectors change by taking their differentials, which follow from the figure above,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nd\\mathbf{e}_r &= \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi d\\varphi, \\\\\nd\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi &= -\\mathbf{e}_r d\\varphi.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nUsing these differential forms, we can conclude that the motion vectors change as follows,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{x} &= r\\mathbf{e}_r, \\\\\n\\mathbf{v} &= \\dot r \\mathbf{e}_r + r\\dot \\varphi \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi, \\\\\n\\mathbf{a} &= (\\ddot r - r\\dot \\varphi^2)\\mathbf{e}_r + (2\\dot r \\dot \\varphi + r\\ddot \\varphi)\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nExample: Circular orbits\nSuppose an object moves in a circular orbit of radius \\(r\\) at a constant angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) due to a central force \\(\\mathbf{F} = -F\\mathbf{e}_r\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the equations of motion. Since the object moves at constant \\(\\omega\\), we have \\(\\dot \\varphi = \\omega = const\\). Using the polar equations for velocity and acceleration, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{v} &= \\dot r \\mathbf{e}_r, \\\\\n\\mathbf{a} &= -r\\omega^2\\mathbf{e}_r + r \\dot \\omega\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi = - \\frac{F}{m}\\mathbf{e}_r.\n\\end{align*}\\] Note we can re-write these equations to get \\(F = m\\omega^2 r\\).\nFind the period \\(\\tau\\) of the orbit.\nWe want the time it takes for \\(\\Delta \\varphi = 2\\pi\\). Since \\(\\Delta \\varphi = \\omega\\tau\\), solving for \\(\\tau\\) gives \\[\\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}.\\]\nSuppose the central force is the gravitational force, \\(F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\). Find the angular velocity, the period, and the orbital velocity as a function of \\(G, M, r\\).\nWe have \\[F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} = m\\omega^2 r \\ \\Longrightarrow \\ \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r^3}} \\ \\Longrightarrow \\ \\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{GM}} r^{3/2}.\\] This is just a special case of Kepler’s third law, \\(\\tau^2 \\propto r^3\\). The orbital velocity is given by \\[v = r\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}.\\]\n\n\n\nExample: Simple pendulum\nConsider the problem of the simple pendulum, where a mass \\(m\\) swings on a massless string of length \\(\\ell\\) under the force of gravity. The string is fixed at one point. Assume no damping is present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the equations of motion from the forces directly.\nThere are two forces in this problem, gravity and the tension in the string, \\[\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{T} + m\\mathbf{g} = -T\\mathbf{e}_r + mg(\\cos\\theta \\mathbf{e}_r - \\sin\\theta\\mathbf{e}_\\theta).\\] Dividing by \\(m\\) and setting equal to the polar form of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), we have \\[\\mathbf{a} = (-T+mg\\cos\\theta)\\mathbf{e}_r - mg\\sin\\theta\\mathbf{e}_\\theta = -m\\ell^2 \\dot \\theta^2 \\mathbf{e}_r + m\\ell^2 \\ddot \\theta \\mathbf{e}_\\theta.\\] This gives two equations of motion, one for the tension and one for the angular acceleration, \\[\\begin{align*}\nT &= m\\ell^2 \\dot\\theta^2 + mg\\cos\\theta, \\\\\n\\ddot \\theta &= -\\frac{g}{\\ell} \\sin\\theta. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFind the equations of motion again, but this time using torques.\nRecall \\(\\mathbf{N} = I \\boldsymbol{\\dot \\omega}\\), where \\(I\\) is the scalar moment of inertia and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\) is the angular velocity vector. In this case, \\(I=m\\ell^2\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\dot \\omega} = \\ddot \\theta \\mathbf{e}_z\\). Then we have \\[I \\boldsymbol{\\dot \\omega} = m\\ell^2 \\ddot \\theta \\mathbf{e}_z \\equiv \\ell\\mathbf{e}_r \\times m\\mathbf{g} = -mg\\ell\\sin\\theta \\mathbf{e}_z = \\mathbf{N},\\] which can be solve to get \\(\\ddot \\theta = -\\frac{g}{\\ell}\\sin\\theta\\). Notice how in this approach we don’t need to worry about the tension at all.\nSuppose \\(\\theta\\) is small. Write down the equations of motion, solve them, and find the period.\nWhen \\(\\theta \\ll 1\\) the small angle approximation applies, \\(\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta\\). In this case, the equation of motion reduces to \\[\\ddot \\theta = -\\frac{g}{\\ell} \\theta,\\] which is just simple harmonic oscillation with angular frequency \\(\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{\\ell}}\\). The solution to SHO is \\[\\theta(t) = A\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi),\\] where \\(A\\) is some amplitude and \\(\\phi\\) is some phase determined by the initial conditions. Finally, solving for the period, we have \\[\\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ell}{g}}.\\]\n\n\n\nCylindrical Coordinates\nCylindrical coordinates extend polar coodinates by adding in the z-axis from the rectangular system,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx &=  r\\cos\\varphi, \\\\\ny &=  r\\sin\\varphi, \\\\\nz &= z.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe basis vectors are \\(\\mathbf{e}_r, \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi, \\mathbf{e}_z\\). Their differential forms are just \\[\\begin{align*}\nd\\mathbf{e}_r &= \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi d\\varphi, \\\\\nd\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi &= -\\mathbf{e}_r d\\varphi \\\\\nd\\mathbf{e}_z &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\\] The motion vectors in cylindrical coordinates are thus given by, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{x} &= r\\mathbf{e}_r, \\\\\n\\mathbf{v} &= \\dot r \\mathbf{e}_r + r\\dot \\varphi \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi + \\dot z \\mathbf{e}_z , \\\\\n\\mathbf{a} &= (\\ddot r - r\\dot \\varphi^2)\\mathbf{e}_r + (2\\dot r \\dot \\varphi + r\\ddot \\varphi)\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi + \\ddot z \\mathbf{e}_z.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nSpherical Coordinates\nSpherical coordinates extend polar coordinates in a slightly different way. The radius \\(r\\) is now 3-dimensional, and there are two angles, a polar angle \\(0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi\\) and an azimuthal angle \\(0 \\leq \\varphi \\leq 2\\pi\\). The conversion to rectangular coordinates is given by, \\[\\begin{align*}\nx &=  r\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi, \\\\\ny &=  r\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi, \\\\\nz &= r\\cos\\theta. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe basis vectors are \\(\\mathbf{e}_r, \\mathbf{e}_\\theta, \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi\\). Deriving the differential forms of these is a good bit more complex. Here they are,\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nd\\mathbf{e}_r &= \\dot\\theta \\sin\\varphi d\\mathbf{e}_\\theta + \\dot\\varphi d\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi, \\\\\nd\\mathbf{e}_\\theta &= - \\dot\\theta \\sin\\varphi d\\mathbf{e}_r - \\dot\\theta \\cos\\varphi d\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi, \\\\\nd\\mathbf{e}_\\varphi &= - \\dot\\varphi \\mathbf{e}_r + \\dot\\theta \\cos\\varphi \\mathbf{e}_\\theta. \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThese can then be used to get the motion vectors in spherical coordinates,\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{r} &= r \\mathbf{e}_r, \\\\\n\\mathbf{v} &= \\dot{r} \\mathbf{e}_r\n+ r \\dot\\theta \\sin\\varphi \\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}\n+ r \\dot\\varphi \\mathbf{e}_{\\varphi}, \\\\\n\\mathbf{a} &= (\\ddot{r} - r \\dot{\\theta}^2 \\sin^2\\varphi\n- r \\dot{\\varphi}^2) \\mathbf{e}_r \\\\\n&\\quad + (r \\ddot\\theta \\sin\\varphi\n+ 2 \\dot{r} \\dot\\theta \\sin\\varphi\n+ 2 r \\dot\\theta \\dot\\varphi \\cos\\varphi) \\mathbf{e}_{\\theta} \\\\\n&\\quad + (r \\ddot\\varphi + 2 \\dot{r} \\dot\\varphi\n- r \\dot{\\theta}^2 \\sin\\varphi \\cos\\varphi) \\mathbf{e}_{\\varphi}.\n\\end{aligned}\\]"
