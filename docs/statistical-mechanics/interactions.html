<p>Now that we’ve covered the fundamentals of classical statistical mechanics we’ll turn ourselves toward an important application of interest: the behavior of real gases, where particles are allowed to interact with each other. Recall the ideal gas assumes only non-interacting particles. We can extend the validity of the ideal gas by finding a virial expansion of the pressure in powers of density. We’ll then use simplified potentials and mean field approximations to derive the important van der Waals equation of state and study its implications. This will then lead to a discussion of liquid-gas phase transitions and critical point behavior.</p>
<section id="cumulant-expansion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cumulant-expansion">Cumulant Expansion</h2>
<p>We’ll start by formulating the statistical mechanics problem for a gas with an arbitrary interaction potential. Consider a gas of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> indistinguishable particles in a fixed container <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> of volume <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. Suppose the gas has a Hamiltonian of the form <span class="math display">\[
H = \sum_{i=1}^N \bigg(\frac{\mathbf{p}_i}{2m} + V(\mathbf{x}_i)\bigg) + U(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_N),
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(V(\mathbf{x}_i)\)</span> is the usual potential specifying that particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> must be inside the container, and <span class="math inline">\(U(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_N)\)</span> is some general interaction potential between the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles. Let’s proceed using the canonical ensemble and try to find the partition function <span class="math inline">\(Z(T,V,N)\)</span>. Following the same logic as we did with the ideal gas, we have <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
Z &amp;= \frac{1}{N! h^{3N}} \int d^{3N} \mathbf{x} \ d^{3N} \mathbf{p} \ e^{-\beta H} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{N! h^{3N}}\int_\mathcal{B} d^{3N} \mathbf{x} \ e^{-\beta U} \int d^{3N} \mathbf{p} \ e^{-\beta\sum \frac{\mathbf{p}_i}{2m}} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{N!} \bigg(\frac{V}{\lambda^3}\bigg)^N \int_\mathcal{B} \frac{d^{3N} \mathbf{x}}{V^N} \ e^{-\beta U},
\end{align*}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2\pi m k_B T}}\)</span> is the Thermal DeBroglie wavelength defined previously. In this form, we recognize that the terms outside the integral are just the partition function of the ideal gas, which we’ll denote by <span class="math inline">\(Z_0\)</span>. If we think of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{V^N}\)</span> is some kind of uniform probability density over the container <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> then we can imagine the above integral being some kind of expected value <span class="math inline">\(\langle e^{-\beta U} \rangle\)</span>. We can thus write the partition function in the simple form <span class="math display">\[
Z = Z_0 \langle e^{-\beta U} \rangle.
\]</span> Notice the expected value can be thought of as a kind of characteristic function for <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, except with <span class="math inline">\(ik\)</span> replaced by <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. If we expand the characteristic function as a series in terms of the moments, we get <span class="math display">\[
Z = Z_0 \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-\beta)^k}{k!} \langle U^k \rangle.
\]</span> That means if we instead look at <span class="math inline">\(\log Z\)</span>, then the sum over the <em>moments</em> will become a sum over the <em>cumulants</em>, giving <span class="math display">\[
\log Z = \log Z_0 + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-\beta)^k}{k!} \langle U^k \rangle_c.
\]</span> This is called the <strong>cumulant expansion</strong>. We’ve created an expansion of the free energy in terms of the cumulants of the interaction potential. Unfortunately though, we still have no systematic way to actually calculate these cumulants.</p>
<section id="pairwise-interactions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pairwise-interactions">Pairwise Interactions</h3>
<p>To make further progress we need to make assumptions about the functional form of the interaction potential. The most obvious first step is to imagine the potential consists only of <em>pairwise</em> interactions. While one could imagine interactions between three particles, four particles, or any higher number of them, it’s the pairwise interactions that encompass the common interactions found in nature for weakly interacting systems. Roughly speaking, provided we aren’t dealing with a dense plasma, pairwise interactions alone yield a sufficient description of the behavior of a gas.</p>
<p>In this form, the full potential <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> breaks up into a sum of potentials <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> over pairs of particles. We’ll assume the pairwise interactions only interact radially and ignore any self-interactions. We can thus write <span class="math display">\[
U(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_N) = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=i+1}^N u(|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j|) \equiv \sum_{i &lt; j} u_{ij} \ .
\]</span></p>
</section>
<section id="quadratic-expansion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quadratic-expansion">Quadratic Expansion</h3>
<p>With this functional form we can proceed to simplify the cumulants one by one. Let’s start with the mean. Notice that since all integrals are over the same potential over the same region, we can think of them as a multiple of a single pairwise integral. There are <span class="math inline">\(\binom{N}{2}\)</span> such integrals. Each integral is only over two coordinates. The rest yield a factor of <span class="math inline">\(V^{N-2}\)</span>. We thus have <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\langle U \rangle_c &amp;= \sum_{i &lt; j} \int_\mathcal{B} \frac{d^{3N} \mathbf{x}}{V^N} \ u_{ij} \\
&amp;= \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \frac{V^{N-2}}{V^N} \int_\mathcal{B} d^3\mathbf{x}_1 \ d^3\mathbf{x}_2 \ u_{12}.
\end{align*}
\]</span> Finally, we can change variables and integrate over the center of mass coordinate <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}\)</span> and relative coordinate <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>. This lets us pull out another factor of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. If we employ the thermodynamic limit and assume the interaction ranges are much less than the size of the container, we have <span class="math display">\[
\langle U \rangle_c \approx \frac{N^2}{2V} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ u(r).
\]</span> Using the same technique we can proceed to find the variance of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> as well. Evidently, we have <span class="math display">\[
\langle U^2 \rangle_c = \sum_{i &lt; j} \sum_{k &lt; \ell} \bigg(\big\langle u_{ij} u_{k\ell} \big\rangle - \big\langle u_{ij} \big\rangle \big\langle u_{k\ell} \big\rangle \bigg).
\]</span> We now have to proceed case-by-case. There are three cases to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Case 1 (<span class="math inline">\(i \neq k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j \neq \ell\)</span>): In this case all the position vectors are distinct. Since each position is independent, we can factor the joint moment to get <span class="math inline">\(\big\langle u_{ij} u_{k\ell} \big\rangle = \big\langle u_{ij} \big\rangle \big\langle u_{k\ell} \big\rangle\)</span>, which of course implies that the contributions of these terms must vanish in the variance calculation.</p></li>
<li><p>Case 2 (<span class="math inline">\(i=k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j \neq \ell\)</span>): In this case exactly two position vectors will be equal in each term. However, we can still change variables by defining <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{ij} \equiv \mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{i\ell} \equiv \mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_\ell\)</span>. These relative position vectors are also independent of each other, which again means we can factor the joint moments to get <span class="math inline">\(\big\langle u_{ij} u_{i\ell} \big\rangle = \big\langle u_{ij} \big\rangle \big\langle u_{i\ell} \big\rangle\)</span>, which implies that the contributions of these terms must also vanish in the variance calculation.</p></li>
<li><p>Case 3 (<span class="math inline">\(i = k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j = \ell\)</span>): The last case is when both pairs are the equal. This just implies that <span class="math inline">\(\big\langle u_{ij} u_{ij} \big\rangle = \big\langle u_{ij}^2\big\rangle\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We finally have then that the variance of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is just <span class="math display">\[
\langle U^2 \rangle_c = \sum_{i &lt; j} \bigg(\big\langle u_{ij}^2 \big\rangle -  \big\langle u_{ij}\big\rangle^2\bigg).
\]</span> In a way this kind of makes sense. The full variance is just the pairwise sum of the individual pairwise variances. Since each moment is just the same integral over <span class="math inline">\(\binom{N}{2}\)</span> possible configurations, we can simplify the expression to <span class="math display">\[
\langle U^2 \rangle_c = \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \bigg[\frac{1}{V}\int_{\mathcal{B}} d^3\mathbf{x} \ u^2(r) - \frac{1}{V^2}\bigg(\int_{\mathcal{B}} d^3\mathbf{x} \ u(r)\bigg) \bigg].
\]</span> In the limit of large <span class="math inline">\(N,V\)</span> the second term will be much smaller than the first, hence we can write <span class="math display">\[
\langle U^2 \rangle_c \approx \frac{N^2}{2V} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ u^2(r).
\]</span> This means to second order in the cumulants we can evidently write <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\log Z &amp;\approx \log Z_0 - \beta \langle U \rangle_c + \frac{\beta^2}{2} \langle U^2 \rangle_c - \cdots \\
&amp;\approx N \log \frac{Ve}{\lambda^3} + \frac{N^2}{2V} \bigg(-\beta \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ u(r) + \frac{\beta^2}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ u^2(r) - \cdots\bigg).
\end{align*}
\]</span> To see what’s going on here it’s most useful to look at the <em>pressure</em>. Using the formula <span class="math inline">\(\beta P = \frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial V}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\beta P = \frac{N}{V} - \frac{N^2}{2V^2} \bigg(-\beta \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ u(r) + \frac{\beta^2}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ u^2(r) - \cdots\bigg).
\]</span> It’s pretty clear now what we’ve done. We’ve created a series for the pressure in powers of the density <span class="math inline">\(n=\frac{N}{V}\)</span>. This series is called the <strong>virial expansion</strong>. Had we kept higher-order interaction terms this series would continue on in higher powers of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\beta P = n - \frac{n^2}{2} \bigg(-\beta\int d^3\mathbf{x} \ u(r) + \frac{\beta^2}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ u^2(r) - \cdots\bigg) + O(n^3).
\]</span> In the most dilute limit we recover the ordinary ideal gas law. The first correction subtracts a term proportional to <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span>. And so on.</p>
</section>
<section id="mayer-function" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mayer-function">Mayer Function</h3>
<p>While it’s nice to have an expansion in terms of the density, what we have isn’t actually practical to work with. In particular, the second virial coefficient is a series of integrals that are not at all obvious to compute. We can attempt to sum it up though by using the expansion of the exponential function to write write <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
-\beta \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ u(r) + \frac{\beta^2}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ u^2(r) - \cdots &amp;= \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-\beta)^k}{k!} u^k(r) \\
&amp;= \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ \bigg[\exp\big(-\beta u(r)\big) - 1\bigg] . \\
\end{align*}
\]</span> If we define the integrand to be <span class="math inline">\(f(r) \equiv \exp\big(-\beta u(r)\big) - 1\)</span>, what we’ve done is found an expansion in terms of various integrals of <span class="math inline">\(f(r)\)</span>, usually called the <strong>Mayer function</strong>. The integral of this function will converge as long as the potential itself decays sufficiently rapidly, e.g.&nbsp;as the van der Waals interaction would. In terms of this function, we can re-write the virial expansion as <span class="math display">\[
\beta P = n - \frac{n^2}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ f(r) + O(n^3).
\]</span> Provided we can integrate this Mayer function for some given interaction potential, we can find an expansion for the pressure at least up to second order in the density. It’s worth noting, however, that this is only a good expansion in the <em>dilute limit</em> when densities are small. In the opposite situation we’d have the <em>dense limit</em>, which describes the behavior of plasmas. In that scenario we’d want to use a completely different type of expansion, e.g.&nbsp;<em>ring diagrams</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, we’d like to be able to look at all the higher virial coefficients as well, not just the second order term. Continuing to do so with cumulants will be cumbersome since we’re always stuck summing these kinds of series. The fact that things come out so cleanly in terms of the Mayer function suggests that we should instead consider expanding things in terms of it rather than the cumulants. This leads to the cluster expansion.</p>

<section id="cluster-expansion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-expansion">Cluster Expansion</h2>
<p>Let’s recall what it is we’re trying to evaluate. We’d like to find an expression for the partition function <span class="math display">\[
Z = Z_0\int_\mathcal{B} \frac{d^{3N} \mathbf{x}}{V^N} \ e^{-\beta U} = Z_0 \int_\mathcal{B} \frac{d^{3N} \mathbf{x}}{V^N} \prod_{i &lt; j} e^{-\beta u_{ij}} \ .
\]</span> If we use the Mayer function to define <span class="math inline">\(f_{ij} \equiv e^{-\beta u_{ij}}\)</span>, we can instead write <span class="math display">\[
Z = \frac{Z_0}{V^N} \int_\mathcal{B} d^{3N} \mathbf{x} \prod_{i &lt; j} (1 + f_{ij}) \equiv \frac{Z_0}{V^N} Q.
\]</span></p>
<section id="cluster-diagrams" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-diagrams">Cluster Diagrams</h3>
<p>Our challenge is to find a way to evaluate this integral over all possible pairs. If we expand the product <span class="math inline">\(\prod (1+f_{ij})\)</span> we’d get a series in increasing powers of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, where each product appears exactly once, <span class="math display">\[
\prod_{i &lt; j} (1 + f_{ij}) = 1 + \sum_{i &lt; j} f_{ij} \ + \sum_{i &lt; j &lt; k &lt; \ell} f_{ij} f_{k\ell} + \cdots \ .
\]</span> It’s helpful to visualize this product in a different way using <em>cluster diagrams</em>. Imagine the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles as representing <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> points in a graph. Think of each product of <span class="math inline">\(f_{ij}\)</span> as an edge connecting the two points <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. In the expansion, a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> represents no points being connected. A single <span class="math inline">\(f_{ij}\)</span> represents only the points <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> being connected. A double term <span class="math inline">\(f_{ij}f_{k\ell}\)</span> represents two connections, one between <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, the other between <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>. And so on for higher order terms.</p>
<p>In this representation, we can schematically represent the general <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> function as the sum over all possible graphs over <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> points, where each sum of <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> powers of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> represents a sum over all graphs with exactly <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> edges, <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
Q &amp;= \int_\mathcal{B} d^{3N} \mathbf{x} \prod_{i &lt; j} (1 + f_{ij}) \\
&amp;= \int_\mathcal{B} d^{3N} \mathbf{x} \bigg[1 + \sum_{i &lt; j} f_{ij} \ + \sum_{i &lt; j &lt; k &lt; \ell} f_{ij} f_{k\ell} + \cdots \bigg] \\
&amp;= \int_\mathcal{B} d^{3N} \mathbf{x} \ \bigg[(\text{disconnected graph}) + \sum (\text{all graphs with one edge}) + \sum (\text{all graphs with two edges}) + \cdots\bigg] \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> Though not necessarily obvious, we can use a trick from graph theory to reorganize this sum over graphs into something more convenient. For any one graph being summed, we can think of it as itself being a <em>product</em> of its own connected components. For example, suppose we had a particular graph of <span class="math inline">\(N=6\)</span> points in which point <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is disconnected, points <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> are connected, and points <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> are all connected to each other. This would represent the product <span class="math display">\[
\int_\mathcal{B} d^{3} \mathbf{x}_1 \int_\mathcal{B} d^{3} \mathbf{x}_2 d^{3} \mathbf{x}_3 \ f_{23} \int_\mathcal{B} d^{3} \mathbf{x}_4 d^{3} \mathbf{x}_5 d^{3} \mathbf{x}_6 \ f_{45} f_{56}.
\]</span> Now, define <span class="math inline">\(b_\ell\)</span> to be the sum of all connected components connecting exactly <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> points. That is, <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> is the sum over all completely disconnected clusters, <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span> is the sum over all pairs of connected edges, <span class="math inline">\(b_3\)</span> is the sum over all triplets of connected points, and so on. Diagrammatically these might look as follows.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="./resources/image-20230718004825738.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="500"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Note how the number of terms in the sum blows up with increasing <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>. For example, <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span> each contain one configuration, <span class="math inline">\(b_3\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> configurations. It turns out that <span class="math inline">\(b_4\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span> different terms. That is, there are <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span> ways to connect <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> points with all possible configurations of edges. Etc.</p>
<p>Now, for each graph being summed over in the <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> function, we expect there to be some number <span class="math inline">\(n_\ell\)</span> of components in that graph connecting exactly <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> points. Taking the product over all of these components for each <span class="math inline">\(\ell = 1, \cdots, N\)</span> then gives the value of that one graph. In doing this, note that some components may end up being over-counted, so we have to include a multiplicity factor <span class="math inline">\(W(\{n_\ell\})\)</span> in each product to correct the counts. In the end, we’re now representing <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> as a sum over all graphs such that each graph contains exactly <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> points and partitions into exactly <span class="math inline">\(n_\ell\)</span> clusters for each allowed <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>. As an equation, this means</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Q = \sideset{}{'}\sum_{\underset{N=\sum n_\ell \ell}{\{n_\ell\}}} W(\{n_\ell\})\prod_{\ell=0}^N b_\ell^{n_\ell} \ .
\]</span> Notice the notation used here. This is a <em>constrained sum</em>, a sum over all partitions <em>such that</em> that <span class="math inline">\(N=\sum_\ell n_\ell \ell\)</span>. The multiplicity factor <span class="math inline">\(W(\{n_\ell\})\)</span> turns out to have the explicit form <span class="math display">\[
W(\{n_\ell\}) = \frac{N!}{\prod_\ell (\ell!)^{n_\ell} n_\ell!}.
\]</span> This comes from the fact that for each graph we’re permuting <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> points. But for each connected component we need to divide out the number of ways of permuting those points. Since there are <span class="math inline">\(n_\ell\)</span> such components, this means we need to divide by <span class="math inline">\((\ell!)^{n_\ell}\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>. We’re still overcounting though, because exchanging any <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> cluster with another <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> cluster shouldn’t change anything, so we also need to divide by <span class="math inline">\(n_\ell!\)</span>. This gives the full multiplicity factor.</p>
<p>At any rate, attempting to sum over all graphs to get <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> still seems like a daunting task. This is mainly due to the constrained sum, which requires that we sum over <em>all</em> possible partition sizes <span class="math inline">\(n_\ell\)</span> consistent with the constraint <span class="math inline">\(\sum \ell n_\ell = N\)</span>. In general finding constrained sums is hard. But there’s a work around. Namely, we can allow <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to vary as well. We can do that by looking not at the <em>canonical</em> partition function <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, but instead the <em>grand canonical</em> partition function <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span>. Then all we have to do is replace any occurrence of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\sum \ell n_\ell\)</span> and sum over all possible partitions <span class="math inline">\(\{n_\ell\}\)</span>. Then we’ll have <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{Z} &amp;= \sum_{N=0}^\infty e^{\beta\mu N} Z \\
&amp;= \sum_{N=0}^\infty e^{\beta\mu N} \sideset{}{'}\sum_{\underset{N=\sum n_\ell \ell}{\{n_\ell\}}} \frac{W(\{n_\ell\})}{N! \lambda^{3N}}\prod_{\ell=0}^N b_\ell^{n_\ell} \\
&amp;= \sum_{\{n_\ell\}} \bigg(\frac{e^{\beta\mu}}{\lambda^3}\bigg)^{\sum \ell n_\ell} \frac{1}{\prod_\ell (\ell!)^{n_\ell} n_\ell!} \prod_{\ell=0}^{\sum \ell n_\ell} b_\ell^{n_\ell} \\
&amp;= \prod_{\ell=1}^\infty \sum_{n_\ell=0}^\infty \frac{b_\ell^{n_\ell}}{(\ell!)^{n_\ell} n_\ell!} \bigg(\frac{e^{\beta\mu}}{\lambda^3}\bigg)^{\ell n_\ell} \\
&amp;= \prod_{\ell=1}^\infty \exp\bigg[\frac{b_\ell}{\ell!} \bigg(\frac{e^{\beta\mu}}{\lambda^3}\bigg)^{\ell}\bigg] \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> Taking the logarithm then converts the product into the simpler sum <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\log \mathcal{Z} = \sum_{\ell=1}^\infty \frac{b_\ell}{\ell!} \bigg(\frac{e^{\beta\mu}}{\lambda^3}\bigg)^{\ell}
} \ .
\]</span></p>

<section id="virial-expansion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="virial-expansion">Virial Expansion</h3>
<p>As with the cumulant expansion, what we’re mainly interested in here is getting a formula for the <em>pressure</em>. The easiest way to do that here is to use extensivity. Using the fact <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G} = -k_B T \log \mathcal{Z} = -PV\)</span> for an extensive system, we can express the pressure as <span class="math display">\[
\beta P = \frac{1}{V} \log \mathcal{Z} = \sum_{\ell=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\ell!} \frac{b_\ell}{V} \bigg(\frac{e^{\beta\mu}}{\lambda^3}\bigg)^{\ell}.
\]</span> Notice that this quantity must be intensive since <span class="math inline">\(\log \mathcal{Z}\)</span> must be extensive and we’re dividing by the volume <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. To make this clear, let’s conveniently define <span class="math inline">\(\textblank_\ell \equiv \frac{b_\ell}{V}\)</span>. Let’s also define <span class="math inline">\(x \equiv \frac{e^{\beta\mu}}{\lambda^3}\)</span>. Noting that <span class="math inline">\(b_1 = V\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(\textblank_1 = 1\)</span>, we can thus write <span class="math display">\[
\beta P = \sum_{\ell=1}^\infty \frac{\textblank_\ell}{\ell!} x^{\ell} = x + \frac{\textblank_2}{2} x^2 + \frac{\textblank_3}{6} x^3 + \cdots \ .
\]</span> We thus have a series for pressure in terms of this scaled fugacity variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. However, what we’d like to get is a <em>virial</em> expansion. That is, we’d like to express the pressure as a series in increasing powers of the density <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\beta P = n + B_2 n^2 + B_3 n^3 + \cdots \ .
\]</span> To do that, recall that we can express <span class="math inline">\(N \approx \langle N \rangle\)</span> in the grand canonical ensemble with the formula <span class="math inline">\(N = \frac{\partial \log \mathcal{Z}}{\partial (\beta\mu)}\)</span>. Dividing both sides by <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and again using extensivity, we can then express the number density <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as its own series in powers of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
n = \frac{1}{V} \frac{\partial \log \mathcal{Z}}{\partial (\beta\mu)} = \sum_{\ell=1}^\infty \frac{\textblank_\ell}{(\ell-1)!} x^{\ell} = x + \textblank_2 x^2 + \frac{\textblank_3}{2} x^3 + \cdots \ .
\]</span> We’ve managed to express both <span class="math inline">\(\beta P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> each as a series expansion in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. To find <span class="math inline">\(\beta P\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> we need to eliminate <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. To do that we need to <em>invert</em> the series <span class="math inline">\(n=n(x)\)</span> to get <span class="math inline">\(x=x(n)\)</span>. In general, there’s no way to invert a series like this and get a closed form solution for <span class="math inline">\(x=x(n)\)</span>. However, we <em>can</em> get a series for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in powers of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. This method will suffice for us, as we’re only interested in the first few terms in the virial expansion anyway.</p>
<p>We’ll proceed as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Naively solve for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> by moving all the non-linear powers to the other side and asserting they must be <span class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
x = n - \textblank_2 x^2 - \frac{\textblank_3}{2} x^3 - \cdots = n + O(n^2).
\]</span> To first order this makes sense, as for small densities the ideal gas expression <span class="math inline">\(\beta P = n\)</span> should be satisfied.</p></li>
<li><p>Substitute <span class="math inline">\(x=n+O(n^2)\)</span> back into the original equation and keep terms up to <span class="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
x &amp;= n - \textblank_2 x^2 - \frac{\textblank_3}{2} x^3 - \cdots \\
&amp;= n - \textblank_2 \big(n+O(n^2)\big)^2 - \frac{\textblank_3}{2} \big(n+O(n^2)\big)^3 - \cdots \\
&amp;= n - \textblank_2 n^2 + O(n^3). \\
\end{align*}
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Substitute <span class="math inline">\(x = n - \textblank_2 n^2 + O(n^3)\)</span> back into the original equation and keep terms up to <span class="math inline">\(O(n^4)\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
x &amp;= n - \textblank_2 x^2 - \frac{\textblank_3}{2} x^3 - \cdots \\
&amp;= n - \textblank_2 \big(n - \textblank_2 n^2 + O(n^3)\big)^2 - \frac{\textblank_3}{2} \big(n - \textblank_2 n^2 + O(n^3)\big)^3 - \cdots \\
&amp;= n - \textblank_2 n^2 + \bigg(2\textblank_2^2 - \frac{\textblank_3}{2}\bigg) n^3 + O(n^4). \\
\end{align*}
\]</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can continue on like this, using the previous result for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to get the expression for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> up to the next highest power in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. We’ll stop here though and plug in this third-order approximation of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> into the formula for <span class="math inline">\(\beta P\)</span>. We have <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\beta P &amp;= x + \frac{\textblank_2}{2} x^2 + \frac{\textblank_3}{6} x^3 + \cdots \\
&amp;\approx \bigg[n - \textblank_2 n^2 + \bigg(2\textblank_2^2 - \frac{\textblank_3}{2}\bigg)n^3\bigg] \\
&amp;+ \frac{\textblank_2}{2}\bigg[n - \textblank_2 n^2 + \bigg(2\textblank_2^2 - \frac{\textblank_3}{2}\bigg)n^3\bigg]^2 \\
&amp;+ \frac{\textblank_3}{6}\bigg[n - \textblank_2 n^2 + \bigg(2\textblank_2^2 - \frac{\textblank_3}{2}\bigg)n^3\bigg]^3. \\
\end{align*}
\]</span> Rearranging terms in increasing powers of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we finally have a virial expansion up to <span class="math inline">\(O(n^4)\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\beta P = n - \frac{\textblank_2}{2} n^2 + \bigg(\textblank_2^2-\frac{\textblank_3}{3}\bigg) n^3 + O(n^4).
\]</span> We now have a systematic way to get a virial expansion up to any arbitrary power of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. After some simplification, the first few virial coefficients turn out to be given by <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
B_1 &amp;= 1 \ , \\
B_2 &amp;= -\frac{\textblank_2}{2} = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathcal{B}} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ f(\mathbf{x}) \ , \\
B_3 &amp;= \bigg(\textblank_2^2-\frac{\textblank_3}{3}\bigg) = -\frac{1}{3} \int_{\mathcal{B}} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ f(\mathbf{x}) f(\mathbf{x}') f(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}') \ . \\
\end{align*}
\]</span> Notice the first two virial coefficients agree with what we calculated from the cumulant expression. The <span class="math inline">\(B_3\)</span> term is new, as we had no easy way to calculate it before. In principle we could keep going to higher order coefficients if we like, but we won’t.</p>
<p>Of course, we still have no way to actually <em>calculate</em> what the virial coefficients are since we don’t know what the interaction potential <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is, hence neither what the Mayer function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is. To proceed further we need to make some assumptions about the interaction potentials involved in a typical gas.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="van-der-waals-interactions">Van der Waals Interactions</h2>
<p>The true interaction forces in real gases can be quite complicated. Typically gases will be electrically neutral, so Coulomb forces don’t tend to play a role. What’s left are much shorter-range forces arising from the permanent or induced dipole interactions between particles. These short-range forces are called <strong>van der Waals forces</strong>. Typically, such forces fall off very rapidly with particle separation due to the background of other molecules, and rapidly increase as the two particles get too close together due to the Pauli exclusion principle forbidding their ability to be on top of each other.</p>
<section id="simple-model" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simple-model">Simple Model</h3>
<p>A very crude model of the van der Waals force that’s decent enough for statistical mechanical purposes is to assume the forces arise from a radially symmetric potential of the form <span class="math display">\[
u(r) =
\begin{cases}
-u_0 \bigg(\frac{r_0}{r}\bigg)^6 &amp; r \geq r_0 \ , \\
\infty &amp; r &lt; r_0 \ . \\
\end{cases}
\]</span> At close distances we’ll assume the force is infinitely repulsive when <span class="math inline">\(r &lt; r_0\)</span>. This <em>hard wall</em> idea approximates the effect that particles will bounce off each other if they get too close, with <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span> usually on the order of Angstroms for atoms or molecules. When <span class="math inline">\(r \gg r_0\)</span> the force becomes weakly attractive due to screening, with the potential falling off like <span class="math inline">\(r^{-6}\)</span>. The other constant <span class="math inline">\(u_0\)</span> characterizes the strength of the interaction, with <span class="math inline">\(u_0\)</span> usually something like room temperature in temperature units.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>We can now proceed to calculate the virial coefficients for such an interaction. We already know <span class="math inline">\(B_1 = 1\)</span>, so there’s nothing to do there. We’ll recover the ideal gas law at low densities as expected. For <span class="math inline">\(B_2\)</span>, we need to find the integral of <span class="math inline">\(f(r)\)</span>, which is <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\int_{\mathcal{B}} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ f(r) &amp;= \int_0^\infty 4\pi r^2 dr \ \big(e^{-\beta u(r)}-1\big) \\
&amp;= -\int_0^{r_0} 4\pi r^2 dr + \int_{r_0}^\infty 4\pi r^2 dr \ \bigg[\exp\bigg(\beta u_0 \bigg(\frac{r_0}{r}\bigg)^6\bigg)-1\bigg] \\
&amp;= -\frac{4\pi}{3} r_0^3 + \int_{r_0}^\infty 4\pi r^2 dr \ \bigg[\exp\bigg(\beta u_0 \bigg(\frac{r_0}{r}\bigg)^6\bigg)-1\bigg] . \\
\end{align*}
\]</span> To get at the second term analytically we’ll have to make a further approximation. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\beta u_0 \ll 1\)</span>, meaning <span class="math inline">\(u_0 \ll k_B T\)</span>. This is the high temperature regime of classical statistical mechanics. Here we can approximate the integral as <span class="math display">\[
\int_{r_0}^\infty 4\pi r^2 dr \ \bigg[\exp\bigg(\beta u_0 \bigg(\frac{r_0}{r}\bigg)^6\bigg)-1\bigg] \approx \int_{r_0}^\infty 4\pi r^2 dr \ \beta u_0\bigg(\frac{r_0}{r}\bigg)^6 = \frac{4\pi}{3} r_0^3 \beta u_0.
\]</span> Notice both terms include the term <span class="math inline">\(\omega \equiv \frac{4\pi}{3} r_0^3\)</span>. This is just the volume of a sphere of radius <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span>, called the <strong>excluded volume</strong>. It’s the volume of each particle’s electron cloud in a sense. In terms of the excluded volume, we can thus write <span class="math inline">\(B_2\)</span> simply as <span class="math display">\[
B_2 = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathcal{B}} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ f(r) = \frac{\omega}{2} (1-\beta u_0).
\]</span> In principle, we could also then proceed to calculate the third virial coefficient <span class="math inline">\(B_3\)</span>. However, this turns out to be much harder, as now we have to integrate over three-particle interactions. We can eliminate one of the coordinates and write <span class="math display">\[
B_3 = -\frac{1}{3} \int_{\mathcal{B}} d^3 \mathbf{x} \ d^3 \mathbf{x}' \ f(\mathbf{x}) f(\mathbf{x}') f(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'),
\]</span> but actually <em>evaluating</em> this integral analytically is an onerous task. Of course, it can often be found numerically. And on the story goes for the higher virial coefficients as well. We’re thus left with the approximation <span class="math display">\[
\beta P = n + \frac{\omega}{2} (1-\beta u_0) n^2 + O(n^3) + \cdots.
\]</span> Let’s just focus on the second order part of this equation and see what happens in that case. Whatever it is should at least be more accurate than the ideal gas approximation. If we group the terms involving <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> on the left-hand side, we have <span class="math display">\[
\beta \bigg(P + \frac{\omega u_0}{2} n^2\bigg) = n + \frac{\omega}{2} n^2 + \cdots \ .
\]</span> Now, for small <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the right-hand side looks like the binomial series expansion for <span class="math inline">\(\big(1-\frac{N\omega}{2}\big)^{-1}\)</span>. Let’s conveniently define two constants, <span class="math inline">\(a \equiv \frac{1}{2} u_0 \Omega\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \equiv \frac{\omega}{2}\)</span>. If we do that and use the fact that <span class="math inline">\(n = \frac{N}{V}\)</span>, we can write the above equation as <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\bigg(P + a\frac{N^2}{V^2}\bigg)(V-Nb) = Nk_B T.
}
\]</span> This well-known equation of state is called the <strong>van der Waals equation</strong>.</p>

<section id="validity-of-van-der-waals" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="validity-of-van-der-waals">Validity of van der Waals</h3>
<p>Before proceeding, it’s worth stepping back and asking whether the virial expansion we just performed is a good expansion, that it makes sense physically. Let’s try to see what might cause the van der Waals equation to fail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>High densities: Clearly if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is large we can’t truncate the virial expansion to second order like we did. We’d need to deal with all the higher order terms as well. Fortunately for a gas this isn’t really an issue. Notice that the series grows like the ratio of the first two terms, which goes like <span class="math display">\[
\frac{B_2n^2}{B_1n} = \frac{\frac{\omega}{2} (1-\beta u_0)n^2}{n} \sim \frac{N\omega}{V}.
\]</span> Roughly speaking, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{N\omega}{V}\)</span> is the density of the gas divided by its density when liquified. For air at STP, we already saw that ratio of densities is about <span class="math inline">\(10^{-3}\)</span>, clearly small enough that we can justify neglecting higher order terms in the expansion. Of course, while this is true for <em>gases</em>, it’s not always true. For example, it’s not true for liquids or plasmas.</p></li>
<li><p>Low temperatures: In deriving the virial coefficient <span class="math inline">\(B_2\)</span> we made the crucial assumption that <span class="math inline">\(k_B T \gg u_0\)</span>. That is, we assumed that temperatures are large compared to the molecular interaction strengths. For gases at room temperatures this is fine, but as temperatures go towards absolute zero things break down and this approximation no longer holds.</p></li>
<li><p>Long-range interactions: Another failure mode we didn’t explicitly mention above is the nature of the interaction potential. We assumed a potential of the form <span class="math inline">\(u(r) \sim r^{-6}\)</span>, which we were able to integrate from <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. If we look back at the integral though, we can see that won’t be true for every power of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. In particular, such an integral will diverge for powers <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; -3\)</span>. This means, for example, that we can’t treat Coulomb interactions this way, where <span class="math inline">\(k=-1\)</span>. These divergent integrals arise when interactions are <em>long-range</em>, i.e.&nbsp;when they don’t fall off reasonably fast. For the van der Waals potential we don’t have this problem. But if we’re dealing with, say plasmas, we do have to worry about this issue. In that case we’d need to do a completely different kind of expansion, e.g.&nbsp;using <em>ring diagrams</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The van der Waals equation was originally derived phenomenologically based on the following two physical arguments:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We expect the available volume to each particle is reduced by an amount proportional to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Each particle occupies a definite volume, namely the excluded volume <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>. As we saw from the hard sphere gas, this means that the available volume gets reduced by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{N\omega}{2}\)</span>, not <span class="math inline">\(N\omega\)</span> as we might expect.</li>
<li>The presence of an interaction strength <span class="math inline">\(u_0\)</span> means each particle spends more time away from the walls of the container due to particles in the center attracting it inward. This has the effect of reducing the pressure on the walls of the container by some amount proportional to <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the lab, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are measured experimentally and tabulated for each gas of interest. For most real gases the parameters tend to be quite small at typical densities. For example, for water, tables give the van der Waals constants in chemistry units as <span class="math inline">\(a = 5.464 \ \frac{\text{L}^2 \ \text{atm}}{\text{mol}^2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b = 0.03049 \ \frac{\text{L}}{\text{mol}}\)</span>. In SI units, these become <span class="math inline">\(a = 1.53 \cdot 10^{-48}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b = 5.06 \cdot 10^{-29}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In typical conditions the pressure correction will often be much larger than the volume correction. With water, the volume correction becomes important when <span class="math inline">\(nb \sim 1\)</span>, or when the mass density gets up to <span class="math inline">\(\rho \sim 0.6 \ \frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^3}\)</span>. Note the density of liquid water is about <span class="math inline">\(\rho \sim 1 \ \frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^3}\)</span>, meaning water practically needs to liquify for the volume correction to become important. Compare that with the pressure correction, which becomes important when <span class="math inline">\(an^2 \ll P\)</span>. At atmospheric pressure, this effect would seem to become important when <span class="math inline">\(\rho \sim 0.008 \ \frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^3}\)</span>, which is much smaller, closer to the density of air in fact.</p>

</section>
<section id="phase-transitions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="phase-transitions">Phase Transitions</h2>
<p>The fact that the van der Waals equation only seems to become important as a gas starts to liquify suggests that we should study this transition region from gas to liquid. This is one of many examples of a <strong>phase transition</strong>, an apparently discontinuous change in the properties of a system. When dealing with gases, phase transitions often manifest as sharp lines in the <em>phase diagram</em>, i.e.&nbsp;a diagram of pressure vs temperature. Such a diagram often looks something like the following.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="./resources/image-20230812012625268.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="400"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Phase diagrams often show similar patterns. At low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> the gas is in its <em>solid phase</em>. All the particles are aligned in something like a crystal lattice. At higher <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> the gas moves into its <em>liquid phase</em>. In this phase, the particles are still close together, but they’re no longer locked into a lattice anymore. They’re allowed to move around on top of each other. As <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> increases further the gas moves into its <em>gas phase</em>. In this phase the particles start to move apart from each other, behaving more and more like an ideal gas where <span class="math inline">\(P \propto T\)</span>.</p>
<p>What’s more interesting are the sharp lines separating the phases. Suppose we fixed <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> relatively high and started increasing <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. The gas starts in its gas phase, but at some pressure <span class="math inline">\(P=P(T)\)</span> the gas undergoes a phase transition, turning sharply into a liquid as it crosses the gas-liquid phase line. What’s more interesting, however, is that this is only true for temperatures below some <strong>critical temperature</strong> <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(T &gt; T_c\)</span> no phase transition happens at all. Something strange evidently happens at this point.</p>
<section id="critical-points" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critical-points">Critical Points</h3>
<p>To understand this in more depth let’s consider again the van der Waals interaction <span class="math inline">\(PV\)</span> diagram. As a function of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
P = \frac{Nk_B T}{V-Nb} - a \frac{N^2}{V^2}.
\]</span> If we plot the isotherms of this equation for different values of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, we get something like the following.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="./resources/image-20230812014318099.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="400"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>First, notice that all the isotherms asymptotically approach the reduced volume <span class="math inline">\(Nb=\frac{N\omega}{2}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(V \rightarrow 0\)</span>. This is a consequence of the physical fact that the gas becomes incompressible once it reaches its liquid phase. The isotherms separate into three distinct regimes depending on whether <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is greater than some special <strong>critical temperature</strong> <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(T \gg T_c\)</span> the <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> term is negligible and we essentially recover the hard sphere isotherms with <span class="math inline">\(P(V-Nb) \propto T\)</span>. These are the <em>green curves</em> plotted. As <span class="math inline">\(V \gg Nb\)</span> these reduce to the ideal gas isotherms with <span class="math inline">\(PV \propto T\)</span>.</li>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(T \ll T_c\)</span> we get the curves plotted in red. Unlike the green curves, these have a region with a wiggle. For a given pressure in this region, the curve seems to imply the gas can coexist at <em>three</em> different volumes (and hence three different densities as well). In reality, one of these is disallowed by thermodynamic stability. The dashed part of the curve is unstable since it has negative compressibility. As we’ll see, the black line correctly describes the curve in this region.</li>
<li>Last, the critical isotherm at <span class="math inline">\(T=T_c\)</span> is plotted in blue. This curve is what separates the first two regimes. Each pressure corresponds to a unique volume, but the curve does have a flat region around some special <em>critical point</em> <span class="math inline">\((V_c,P_c)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can pretty easily solve for the critical values <span class="math inline">\((T_c,V_c,P_c)\)</span>. Since we have three values to solve for, we need to find three independent equations. The first is easy, as <span class="math inline">\((T,V,P)\)</span> must clearly satisfy the van der Waals equation to lie on any of these curves at all. For the other two equations, we impose the condition that we’re on the <span class="math inline">\(T=T_c\)</span> isotherm. A sufficient condition for this to hold is that the first and second derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(P(V)\)</span> must vanish at the critical point. That is, we need to solve the following, <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
P &amp;= \frac{Nk_B T}{V-Nb} - a \frac{N^2}{V^2} \ , \\
\frac{\partial P}{\partial V} \bigg |_{T,N} &amp;= -\frac{Nk_B T}{(V-Nb)^2} + 2a \frac{N^2}{V^3} \equiv 0 \ , \\
\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial V^2} \bigg |_{T,N} &amp;= 2\frac{Nk_B T}{(V-Nb)^3} - 6a \frac{N^2}{V^4} \equiv 0 \ . \\
\end{align*}
\]</span> These can be simultaneously solved to give <span class="math display">\[
T_c = \frac{8a}{27k_Bb} , \qquad V_c = 3Nb , \qquad P_c = \frac{a}{27b^2} \ .
\]</span> The second equation is more often expressed in terms of a <em>critical density</em> to get rid of the dependence on <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, defined by <span class="math inline">\(\rho_c \equiv mn_c \equiv \frac{Nm}{V_c}\)</span>. As an example, for water, the critical values would be <span class="math display">\[
T_c \approx 650 \ ^\circ \text{K} \ , \qquad \rho_c \approx 0.19 \ \frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^3} \ , \qquad P_c \approx 218 \text{ atm} \ .
\]</span> Note that while <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_c\)</span> agree with experiment, the critical density is slightly off. The measured value is actually <span class="math inline">\(\rho_c \approx 0.33\)</span> in the same units. This discrepancy has to do with dipole-dipole interactions among water molecules that we’re not accounting for.</p>
</section>
<section id="stability" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stability">Stability</h3>
<p>But what exactly do these critical values represent? Clearly something is going on around the critical temperature that we should investigate. Above <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> everything appears to be what we’d expect. We recover ideal gas like behavior, with some minor corrections as <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow T_c\)</span> from above. Let’s look at the situation where <span class="math inline">\(T &lt; T_c\)</span> and see what might be happening. As mentioned above, the isotherms in this region exhibit non-physical behavior in the regions where the slope of the curve is increasing. Such a phenomenon would imply <em>negative compressibility</em>, since in the positively-sloped region we’d have <span class="math display">\[
\kappa = -\frac{1}{V} \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \bigg |_{T,N} &lt; 0.
\]</span> Negative compressibility would imply a gas gets <em>bigger</em> as the pressure on it increases. But this is thermodynamically unstable. In fact it even violates the laws of statistical mechanics. To see why, recall by extensivity we have <span class="math inline">\(\log \mathcal{Z} = \beta PV\)</span>, which implies <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
N &amp;\approx \langle N \rangle = \frac{\partial \log\mathcal{Z}}{\partial (\beta\mu)} = V\frac{\partial P}{\partial \mu} \bigg |_T \ , \\
\sigma_N^2 &amp;= \frac{\partial^2 \log\mathcal{Z}}{\partial (\beta\mu)^2} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial (\beta\mu)} = k_B T \frac{\partial N}{\partial \mu} \bigg |_T \ . \\
\end{align*}
\]</span> Dividing the two expressions and using the chain rule, we have <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sigma_N^2}{N} &amp;= \frac{k_B T \frac{\partial N}{\partial \mu} \big |_T}{V\frac{\partial P}{\partial \mu} \big |_T} \\
&amp;= \frac{k_B T}{V} \frac{\partial N}{\partial P} \bigg |_T \\
&amp;= \frac{k_B T}{V} \bigg(-\frac{\partial N}{\partial V} \bigg |_{T,P} \ \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \bigg |_{T,N}\bigg) \\
&amp;= -\frac{k_B T}{V} \frac{N}{V} \ \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \bigg |_{T,N} \\
&amp;= \frac{N k_B T}{V} \bigg(- \frac{1}{V} \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \bigg |_{T,N} \bigg) \\
&amp;= n k_B T \ \kappa_T \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> Now, recall the variance of a random variable must always be non-negative. This implies the above ratio must also be non-negative, which implies the compressibility must be as well. From thermodynamics, we also know that this must also imply thermodynamical stability <span class="math inline">\(\delta P \delta V \leq 0\)</span>, which we saw is equivalent to having <span class="math inline">\(\kappa \geq 0\)</span>. These stability conditions are essentially what determine which states are allowed and which aren’t. Thermodynamically <em>unstable</em> states can’t really happen, at least with any reasonable probability in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

<section id="maxwell-construction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maxwell-construction">Maxwell Construction</h3>
<p>So what’s going on in the subcritical region where <span class="math inline">\(T &lt; T_c\)</span>? In fact a <em>phase transition</em> is happening. Imagine varying the pressure on the gas and seeing how the volume (and hence the density) of the gas changes, e.g.&nbsp;by applying a force to a piston.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>At low pressures the allowed states are on the far right of the subcritical isotherms. In this region the ideal gas law more or less holds, perhaps with minor corrections. Any small changes in pressure will cause proportionally small changes in the volume of the gas. That is, the gas behaves like a gas. It’s in its <em>gas phase</em>.</li>
<li>At high pressures the allowed states are instead on the far left of the isotherms, asymptotically approaching the barrier at the excluded volume <span class="math inline">\(Nb\)</span>. In this region, to get a small change in volume we’d need to apply a huge change in pressure. The gas is almost incompressible. In fact, the gas is in its <em>liquid phase</em>, since <span class="math inline">\(V \approx Nb\)</span> implies the particles are densely packed together.</li>
<li>In between these two regions the gas is in <em>coexistence</em>. At a given pressure <span class="math inline">\(P_{co}\)</span>, the curve takes on <em>three</em> distinct volumes (i.e.&nbsp;three densities). Two of these volumes are <em>stable</em>, meaning they can occur. The third is <em>unstable</em>, meaning it can’t occur. This means if we’re exactly at <span class="math inline">\(P_{co}\)</span> the gas seemingly exists in two volumes at once, call them <span class="math inline">\(V_{gas}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_{liq}\)</span>. This region of the <span class="math inline">\(PV\)</span> diagram where two densities can simultaneously coexist is called the <strong>coexistence region</strong>. Due to the discontinuity, when crossing this region, the volume of the gas will evidently change by some discontinuous amount <span class="math inline">\(\Delta V = V_{gas} - V_{liq}\)</span> as it apparently undergoes a phase transition from liquid to gas or vice versa.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, the van der Waals equation isn’t right for a real gas at arbitrary densities. It’s only a dilute approximation. It should and indeed does fail for dense gases. That it’s predicting the behavior of a liquid and the phase transition is thus interesting. Maybe we can correct the equation to work even better by fixing what’s going on in the coexistence region.</p>
<p>Consider again the formula for the particle number along an isotherm, <span class="math display">\[
N = V\frac{\partial P}{\partial \mu} \bigg |_T.
\]</span> To get the chemical potential along an isotherm we can rearrange and integrate <span class="math inline">\(d\mu = \frac{V}{N}dP\)</span> to get <span class="math display">\[
\mu(P) - \mu(P_0) = \int_{P_0}^P dP' \ \frac{V(P')}{N}.
\]</span> Let’s stop and think about what this integration is doing. It’s summing up horizontal slices under the isotherm from <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. As long as <span class="math inline">\(V(P)\)</span> is single-valued this is perfectly fine. But inside the coexistence region <span class="math inline">\(V(P)\)</span> is <em>not</em> single-valued, which means the integral will be <em>path-dependent</em>. For example, consider the following situation. Suppose we wanted to find the chemical potential from the point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to the point <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> along the isotherm shown below.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>Along the path <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> the chemical potential <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> keeps increasing since <span class="math inline">\(dP\)</span> is positive. Along <span class="math inline">\(CD\)</span> though <span class="math inline">\(dP\)</span> is negative, which means <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> goes back down. Then, along <span class="math inline">\(DF\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(dP\)</span> is positive again, causing <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> to again start increasing. The trajectory <span class="math inline">\(\mu(P)\)</span> will cross at the points <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, causing the chemical potential to seemingly be multiple-valued in the region between <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. This crossing point occurs at the coexistence pressure <span class="math inline">\(P_{co}=P_E=P_B\)</span>.</p>
<p>To fix this problem we can make use of the thermodynamical fact that in equilibrium the gas should seek out the <em>lowest</em> available chemical potential at a given temperature and pressure. This means that in the multiple-valued region the gas should only traverse lower part of the path between <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> i.e.&nbsp;the path <span class="math inline">\(ABF\)</span>. For this to be true the closed loop <span class="math inline">\(CDE\)</span> should vanish, <span class="math display">\[
\oint_{P_B}^{P_E} dP \ \frac{V(P)}{N} = 0 .
\]</span> This is equivalent to saying the chemical potentials in the liquid and gas phases should equal in coexistence, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{liq}=\mu_{gas}\)</span>. That is, in coexistence the gas is in <strong>chemical equilibrium</strong>, with the liquid and gas portions exchanging particles at an equal rate.</p>
<p>Enforcing chemical equilibrium is equivalent to finding <span class="math inline">\(P_{co}\)</span> by drawing a horizontal line between the points <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> on the isotherm such that the areas in regions <span class="math inline">\(BDO\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(OCB\)</span> equal and cancel out. This method of graphically finding this pressure is called the <strong>Maxwell construction</strong>. This sort of thing can be done in the lab by starting with a liquid at pressure <span class="math inline">\(P_{liq}\)</span> and slowly decreasing the pressure at constant temperature until the same value <span class="math inline">\(P_{co}\)</span> occurs twice for two different volumes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Maxwell construction seems to predict that at coexistence a gas can take on <em>any volume</em> between <span class="math inline">\(V_{liq}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_{gas}\)</span>. The construction doesn’t tell us, however, which of these volumes will be taken on for a given gas in coexistence. We simply don’t know. Any mixture of densities in this region is possible.</p>
<p>Another relic of the Maxwell construction evidently is that the coexistence line extends beyond the non-physical region. While these added regions indeed have positive compressibility, they’re in fact <em>metastable</em>. It’s possible to show their chemical potential is in fact <em>higher</em> than the chemical equilibrium potential, for a given pressure and temperature. However, if we compress the gas very slowly we can coax the system into a metastable state. These states create what’s known as a super-cooled or super-heated liquid. But in these states <em>any</em> small disturbance will cause some amount of the gas to condense into the liquid, or vice versa.</p>

<p>We can also investigate the behavior of the coexistence region in the phase diagram. In the phase diagram, coexistence occurs along the sharp curve separating the gas and liquid phases. Along this curve the gas must again be in chemical equilibrium. We can use this condition to figure out the functional forms of these curves.</p>
<p>Recall by extensivity the chemical potential is just the Gibbs free energy per particle, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(G = \mu N\)</span>. In each phase we must have <span class="math display">\[
dG = -SdT + VdP.
\]</span> Dividing both sides by <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and asserting the chemical equilibrium condition <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{liq}=\mu_{gas}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
d\mu_{liq} = -s_{liq} dT + v_{liq} dP = -s_{gas} dT + v_{gas} dP = d\mu_{gas},
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s \equiv \frac{S}{N}\)</span> is the entropy per particle and <span class="math inline">\(v \equiv \frac{V}{N}\)</span> is the volume per particle. Rearranging this formula thus says that the <em>slope</em> of the coexistence line in the phase diagram must satisfy <span class="math display">\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{s_{gas}-s_{liq}}{v_{gas}-v_{liq}} = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta v}.
\]</span> Since the entropy and volume in the gas phase will practically always exceed their values in the liquid phase, we can immediately conclude that the slope of this coexistence curve will generally be positive.</p>
<p>It’s more common to write this expression in terms of the <strong>specific latent heat</strong>, defined by <span class="math inline">\(L \equiv T\Delta s\)</span>. This is the amount of heat released per particle as the gas passes through the phase transition. In this form the formula for the slope of the coexistence line is called the <strong>Clausius-Clapyron equation</strong>, <span class="math display">\[
\boxed{
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{L}{T \Delta v}
} \ .
\]</span> In principle this can be a difficult formula to solve since we need to calculate the entropy of both phases. We can often make some simplifying assumptions though. For example, it’s often the case that <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is roughly constant and <span class="math inline">\(v_{gas} \gg v_{liq}\)</span>. If we further assume the ideal gas law is approximately valid, we can write <span class="math inline">\(v_{gas} \approx \frac{k_B T}{P}\)</span>. Together, these imply <span class="math display">\[
\frac{dP}{dT} \approx \frac{LP}{k_B T^2} \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad P(T) \approx P_0 \exp\bigg[-\frac{L}{k_B} \bigg(\frac{1}{T}-\frac{1}{T_0}\bigg)\bigg] \ .
\]</span> Such a curve has the interesting behavior of being convex near <span class="math inline">\(T \approx T_0\)</span> before eventually turning over like <span class="math inline">\(P \sim -\frac{1}{T}\)</span>. Typically <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> is some reference temperature like room temperature or the triple point. Of course, the curve completely stops at the critical temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> anyway, so the high-temperature behavior of the curve is often unimportant.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>Note that this formula can also be used just as well for gas-solid phase transitions, except with <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> taking on a different value due to the different type of chemical equilibrium in that case. The solid-liquid transition is a different story. There we can’t use these approximations at all. These coexistence curves can take on very different shapes. For example, the coexistence curve between water and ice is <em>negatively-sloped</em>. This means ice is <em>less</em> dense than water, which is why ice floats on water.</p>

<p>While the Maxwell construction can be practically useful, from a theoretical perspective we’d like an approach that doesn’t require merely ad hoc fixing van der Waals equation to work in the coexistence region. Let’s step back and see if we can look at subcritical behavior from a more fundamental perspective.</p>
<section id="uniform-density-approximation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="uniform-density-approximation">Uniform Density Approximation</h3>
<p>Consider again the <em>hard sphere gas</em> of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles in a container of volume <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, except we’ll allow for a general potential energy <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. Recall with the hard sphere gas each particle is allowed to occupy some finite volume <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> of radius <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span>. The full Hamiltonian is <span class="math display">\[
H = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\mathbf{p}_i^2}{2m} + U(\mathbf{x}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_N).
\]</span> Now, suppose <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> can be broken up into two components: One component to deal with the hard sphere gas potential, and the other to deal with all possible pairwise interactions <span class="math inline">\(u(|\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j|)\)</span>. Through some clever notation, we can write <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[
U = \sum_{i&lt;j} u(|\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j|) = \frac{1}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ d^3\mathbf{x}' \ n(\mathbf{x}) n(\mathbf{x}') u(|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|),
\]</span> where each <span class="math inline">\(n(\mathbf{x})\)</span> is the <em>density</em> of the <em>count</em> of the number of particles <span class="math inline">\(N(\mathbf{x})\)</span> that appear at the point <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>. That is, <span class="math display">\[
n(\mathbf{x}) \equiv \bigg | \frac{dN(\mathbf{x})}{d\mathbf{x}} \bigg | = \sum_{i=1}^N \delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_i) \ .
\]</span> Notice now what we’re doing is looking at the potential not in terms of each particle, but instead in terms of each point in the container. We’re essentially asking, for each point, is there a particle there that contributes to the potential. This different way of viewing the problem will allow us to do the following clever approximation, often called a <em>mean field approximation</em>.</p>
<p>Suppose that each point in the container contains on average the same density of particles <span class="math inline">\(\overline n\)</span>. That is, the gas uniformly fills the container with constant number density <span class="math inline">\(\overline n = \frac{N}{V}\)</span>. Using this fact, we can replace each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\overline n\)</span> in the integral. Using this plus the usual trick of expressing pairs of coordinates in center of mass and relative coordinates, we can write <span class="math display">\[
U = \frac{\overline n^2}{2} \int d^3\mathbf{x} \ d^3\mathbf{x}' \ u(|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|) = \frac{\overline n^2 V}{2} \int_{r_0}^\infty 4\pi r^2 dr \ u(r) \ .
\]</span> Notice the integral over <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> doesn’t depend on which particles we’re talking about. For a short-range potential like the van der Waals interaction, we can assume it converges to some finite positive area <span class="math inline">\(-a\)</span> and just write <span class="math display">\[
U = -\frac{\overline n^2 V a}{2} = -\frac{\overline N^2 a}{2V}.
\]</span> Let’s now plug all of this into the canonical partition function. Since <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is constant, we can pull it outside the integral to get <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
Z &amp;= \frac{1}{N! h^{3N}} \int d^{3N} \mathbf{x} \ d^{3N} \mathbf{p} \ e^{-\beta H} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{N! \lambda^{3N}} \int_\text{Hard Sphere} d^{3N} \mathbf{x} \ e^{-\beta U} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{N! \lambda^{3N}} \exp\bigg(-\frac{\beta N^2 a}{2V}\bigg) \int_\text{Hard Sphere} d^{3N} \mathbf{x} \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> Note we can’t just assume the spatial integral integrates to <span class="math inline">\(V^N\)</span> anymore since we’re dealing with a hard sphere gas. Recall for the hard sphere gas that this integral turns out to be not the <em>full volume</em> <span class="math inline">\(V^N\)</span>, but the <em>reduced volume</em> <span class="math inline">\(\big(V-\frac{N\omega}{2}\big)^N\)</span>. Defining again the reduced volume per particle to be <span class="math inline">\(b \equiv \frac{\omega}{2}\)</span>, we finally have <span class="math display">\[
Z = \frac{(V-Nb)^N}{N! \lambda^{3N}} \exp\bigg(-\frac{\beta N^2 a}{2V}\bigg).
\]</span> If we take the logarithm of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> we can again find the pressure. We again get the familiar van der Waals equation, except this time without having to do a virial expansion, <span class="math display">\[
\bigg(P + a\frac{N^2}{V^2}\bigg)(V-Nb) = Nk_B T \ .
\]</span> What’s interesting about this is we’ve made the assumptions needed to derive the van der Waals equation fully transparent. It’s the equation of state arising for a <em>hard sphere</em> gas assuming it <em>uniformly</em> fills its container. The latter assumption explains why the van der Waals equation is problematic for explaining gases in the coexistence region. In coexistence, a gas exists simultaneously in two phases, the gas phase and the liquid phase. This necessarily means the gas can’t be uniformly dense, for if it were it would be all gas or all liquid, not both.</p>

<section id="isobaric-perspective" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="isobaric-perspective">Isobaric Perspective</h3>
<p>If we want to understand the behavior of a gas in coexistence, it’s important that we allow the density to vary. Perhaps the easiest way to do this is to use the <em>same</em> mean field approximation, but to work in a different ensemble. We want to be in an ensemble that allows us to vary the density <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. One way to do that is to vary the <em>volume</em> while keeping the <em>pressure</em> fixed. The Gibbs or <em>isobaric</em> ensemble is the natural ensemble for this purpose. Recall we can write the Gibbs partition function <span class="math inline">\(Z_G\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[
Z_G(T,P,N) = \int_0^\infty dV \ e^{-\beta PV} Z(T,V,N) \ .
\]</span> Physically, working in the isobaric ensemble is equivalent to placing a piston at the top of the container and applying some external <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. For the pressure to equilibrate, the density must be uniform inside the container. This means such a system cannot tolerate coexistence. It will choose whether to be in the liquid phase or the gas phase depending on <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</p>
<p>Trying to perform the integration for <span class="math inline">\(Z_G\)</span> is pretty hopeless, but fortunately we don’t need to. We’re just trying to understand the behavior of a gas in coexistence. To that end, define <span class="math inline">\(\psi(V)\)</span> to be the logarithm of the integrand, <span class="math display">\[
\psi(V) \equiv -\beta PV + \log Z .
\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is extensive, we can employ the saddlepoint approximation and approximate the integral as the integrand around the global maximum volume <span class="math inline">\(V^*\)</span> to get <span class="math inline">\(Z_G \approx e^{-\psi(V^*)}\)</span>. To find <span class="math inline">\(V^*\)</span> we again imply the usual trick of setting the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> to zero, <span class="math display">\[
\frac{d\psi}{dV} = -\beta P + \frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial V} \bigg |_{V=V^*} = 0 \ .
\]</span> Now, notice that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial V} = \beta P_{\text{vdW}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(P_{\text{vdW}}\)</span> is the pressure from the van der Waals equation. Evidently then, the integrand is maximized when the pressure on the gas equals its van der Waals pressure at <span class="math inline">\(V^*\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;when <span class="math inline">\(P = P_{\text{vdW}}(V^*)\)</span>.</p>
<p>So what is this saying exactly? Remember that the external pressure <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is fixed. It’s being applied on the system. This corresponds to picking a horizontal line on the <span class="math inline">\(PV\)</span> diagram, intersecting it with the van der Waals isotherm at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and reading off the volume where the two curves intersect as <span class="math inline">\(V=V^*\)</span>. As long as <span class="math inline">\(V_{\text{vdW}}(P)\)</span> is single-valued this is fine since the curves will intersect at exactly one volume (and hence exactly one density since <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is fixed).</p>
<p>But inside the coexistence region something different happens. In that case <span class="math inline">\(V^* = V_{\text{vdW}}(P)\)</span> will be multi-valued. It will in fact return <em>three</em> possible extrema that intersect the line of constant <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Of course, one of these extrema will be non-physical as we saw with the Maxwell construction, meaning we’re left with only two possible extrema intersecting the isotherm on the left and right ends. Call the volumes at these extrema <span class="math inline">\(V_{liq}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_{gas}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is fixed, these will also correspond to two densities <span class="math inline">\(n_{liq}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{gas}\)</span>. That is, at such a pressure <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, we have coexistence of the two phases.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to look at the situation graphically. Suppose we plot <span class="math inline">\(Z_G \approx e^{\psi(V)}\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> for a given pressure <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Suppose we’re below the critical temperature so phase transitions can occur. If <span class="math inline">\(P \gg P_c\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(Z_G\)</span> will peak at a unique volume <span class="math inline">\(V^* \sim Nb\)</span>. That is, we’re uniquely in the liquid phase. If <span class="math inline">\(P \ll P_c\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(Z_G\)</span> will peak at a different volume <span class="math inline">\(V^* \gg Nb\)</span>. That is, we’re uniquely in the gas phase. When <span class="math inline">\(P \sim P_c\)</span> we’re in the multi-valued situation, where <span class="math inline">\(Z_G\)</span> will peak at two extrema according to something like <span class="math display">\[
Z_G \sim e^{\psi(V_{liq})} + e^{\psi(V_{gas})} \ .
\]</span> Typically one of these peaks will be exponentially larger than the other for a given pressure, but as the pressure changes the two peaks may flip, corresponding to a phase transition. What about the third extremum? In fact it’s a <em>minimum</em> on the <span class="math inline">\(Z_G\)</span> curve, which is why we can think of it as a non-physical (i.e.&nbsp;highly improbable) state.</p>

<p>Note that by extensivity we can also write <span class="math inline">\(Z_G \approx e^{-\beta \mu N}\)</span>. This means that maximizing <span class="math inline">\(Z_G\)</span> is equivalent to <em>minimizing</em> the chemical potential <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. This is in a sense the statistical justification behind the Maxwell construction, which we got by picking the part of the integration path of <span class="math inline">\(\mu(P,T)\)</span> with the lowest chemical potential.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ising-model">Ising Model</h2>
<p>We can look at phase transitions yet another way using a very different type of model called an <strong>Ising model</strong>. Ising models were originally created to understand the phase transitions in ferromagnets, where an external magnetic field can flip the spins of particles inside the magnet, causing it to change its polarization. It turns out, though, that such simplified models can be used to understand many other types of phase transitions as well. We’ll focus on models for the liquid-gas transition here.</p>
<section id="model" class="level3">

<p>Suppose we again have <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles that for simplicity are laid out in a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-dimensional grid. Of course, in the real world <span class="math inline">\(d=3\)</span> and particles need not be locked into a grid, but we want to keep things simple for now. We’ll suppose each particle can only interact with its nearest neighbors. It’s not hard to show by induction that a particle in <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> dimensions has exactly <span class="math inline">\(2d\)</span> neighbors assuming diagonals are excluded. We’ll assume a Hamiltonian of the form <span class="math display">\[
H = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma_i \sigma_j - h \sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i.
\]</span> Here the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\langle i,j \rangle\)</span> means to sum over all <span class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> nearest neighbor pairs. Each <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_i=-1,1\)</span> is a binary value representing whether particle <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is in its gas state (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_i=1\)</span>) or liquid state (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_i=-1\)</span>). We’ll call these <em>spins</em> for historical reasons. The parameter <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> is a measure of the strength of interaction between nearest neighbor pairs. We’ll assume each pair has the same interaction strength. Last, the parameter <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is some sort of external field we imagine being allowed to vary. For magnets, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> might represent an applied external magnetic field. For gases, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> would typically represent the chemical potential relative to equilibrium.</p>
<p>Given this Hamiltonian, we can again find its partition function and study its thermodynamic behavior. Since this is a discrete system the integral over phase space gets replaced by a sum over all possible states, which in this case are all possible configurations of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1, \cdots, \sigma_N\)</span>. Working in the canonical ensemble and assuming particles are identical, we have <span class="math display">\[
Z = \frac{1}{N!} \sum_{\{\sigma_i\}} \exp\bigg[-\beta\bigg(-J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma_i \sigma_j - h \sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i\bigg)\bigg] \ .

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mean-field-approximation">Mean Field Approximation</h3>
<p>Trying to sum over all nearest-neighbor pairs is highly non-trivial. To proceed we’ll again invoke the mean field approximation. Provided <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is sufficiently large, it’s reasonable to assume the spin each particle feels from one of its neighbors is roughly the average spin it feels from all its neighbors. Calling that average spin <span class="math inline">\(m \equiv \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \langle \sigma \rangle\)</span>, we can re-write each pair as <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_i \sigma_j = (\sigma_i-m)(\sigma_j-m) + m(\sigma_i + \sigma_j) - m^2 \ .
\]</span> If we assume each <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_i \approx m\)</span> then each <span class="math inline">\((\sigma_i-m)\)</span> will be small. Since the first term above is second-order small we’ll neglect it, <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_i \sigma_j \approx m(\sigma_i + \sigma_j) - m^2 \ .
\]</span> With this approximation we can replace each <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2d}{2} \sum_i\)</span> and simplify the Hamiltonian to get <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
H &amp;= -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \big(m(\sigma_i + \sigma_j) - m^2\big) - h \sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i \\
&amp;= dJNm^2 - (2dJm + h) \sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> The partition function can then be factored as a product of single-particle partition functions and simplified as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
Z &amp;= \frac{1}{N!} \sum_{\{\sigma_i\}} \exp\bigg[-\beta\bigg(dJNm^2 - (2dJm + h) \sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i \bigg)\bigg] \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{N!} e^{-\beta dJNm^2}\bigg(\sum_{\sigma=\pm 1} e^{\beta(2dJm + h)\sigma} \bigg)^N \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{N!} e^{-\beta dJNm^2} \bigg(e^{\beta(2dJm + h)} + e^{-\beta(2dJm + h)} \bigg)^N \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{N!} e^{-\beta dJNm^2} \cosh^N\big(2dJm\beta + h\beta\big) \ .
\end{align*}
\]</span> Of course, we still don’t know <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. To get <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> we need to impose the self consistency constraint that it equals the average spin, <span class="math display">\[
m = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \langle \sigma \rangle = \frac{1}{N\beta} \frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial h}.

<p>There’s no way to exactly solve this equation, but we don’t need to. We just want to understand the behavior of phase transitions. To do that we’ll resort to graphical methods. Let’s change variables by defining <span class="math inline">\(x \equiv \frac{k_B T}{2dJ}m\)</span>. Then we get <span class="math display">\[
\frac{k_B T}{2dJ} x = \tanh\bigg(x + \frac{h}{k_B T}\bigg).
\]</span> Let’s start with the simplest case where there’s no external field, so <span class="math inline">\(h=0\)</span>. In this case we seek the points of intersection between the line <span class="math inline">\(y=\frac{k_B T}{2dJ}x\)</span> and the curve <span class="math inline">\(y=\tanh(x)\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(\tanh\)</span> function looks like a sigmoid function. Near the origin it’s basically linear, with <span class="math inline">\(\tanh x \approx x\)</span>. As <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> gets larger the function turns over and asymptotes to <span class="math inline">\(\tanh x \approx \pm 1\)</span> depending on the sign. This means that the <em>slope</em> of the line determines how many points of intersection there are. In fact, the slope of the line defines a <em>critical temperature</em> <span class="math inline">\(T_c \equiv \frac{2dJ}{k_B}\)</span>. As with the van der Waals equation there are three different possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(T &gt; T_c\)</span> the two curves intersect only at the origin. This corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span>. The temperature is high enough in this case that average spin <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is completely randomized. The entropy associated with the random temperature fluctuations wins over the energetically preferred state in which the spins align. This is analogous to the supercritical isotherms we saw.</li>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(T &lt; T_c\)</span> the two curves still intersect at <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span>, except now they also intersect at two other symmetric points <span class="math inline">\(m = \pm m_0\)</span>. The solution at the origin turns out to be unstable, leaving only the two points <span class="math inline">\(\pm m_0\)</span>. Here we see the effects of the interactions between the spins begin to win over temperature. As <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow 0\)</span> it seems <span class="math inline">\(m_0 \approx \pm 1\)</span>. That is, at zero temperature all the spins are aligned in the same direction, either all up or all down. This is analogous to the subcritical isotherms we saw.</li>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(T = T_c\)</span> the two curves are basically the exact same line near the origin, but not exactly due to second order error. This means the curves only intersect at <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span>, but if <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> decreases any infinitesimal amount the two other solutions will appear. This is analogous to the critical isotherm we saw.</li>
</ul>

<p>The results described above are perhaps rather surprising. Based on the intuition that things in physics always happen smoothly, one might have thought that <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> would decrease slowly to zero as <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. But that’s not what happens. Instead <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> turns off abruptly at some finite temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>. This is the characteristic behavior of a phase transition. Because it arises from the first derivative of the free energy it’s by convention called a <em>first-order phase transition</em>. This contrasts with higher-order phase transitions, which arise from discontinuities in higher derivatives of the free energy.</p>
<p>What happens now if we turn on an external field, allowing <span class="math inline">\(h \neq 0\)</span>? If we look at the above equation, we can see that the presence of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> seems to shift the zero point of the <span class="math inline">\(\tanh\)</span> function left or right depending on the sign of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. Meanwhile the left-hand line doesn’t shift at all. What does this do to the system? It breaks the symmetry. For <em>any</em> <span class="math inline">\(T &lt; \infty\)</span> it’s impossible to get <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span>. Moreover, since the shift <span class="math inline">\(\frac{h}{k_B T} \rightarrow 0\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> will now go smoothly to zero. There’s no longer a phase transition. In fact, it’s possible to show that when <span class="math inline">\(T &lt; T_c\)</span> only one of the intersection endpoints will be stable, which means the spins will always prefer one state over the other. This sort of phenomenon is called <em>spontaneous symmetry breaking</em>. Even the slightest stray external field is enough to ruin the ability of a phase transition to occur.</p>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that strictly speaking the mean field approximation only holds as <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow \infty\)</span> due to the law of large numbers. In fact, the mean field approximation doesn’t work <em>at all</em> when <span class="math inline">\(d=1\)</span>. It can even be shown that phase transitions cannot exist in one-dimension. Yet, for <span class="math inline">\(d \geq 2\)</span> it’s perhaps surprising that the approximation is okay, at least qualitatively. Even by <span class="math inline">\(d=2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d=3\)</span> phase transitions already start to occur in the Ising model. Proving phase transitions indeed occur in these lower dimensions is somewhat more difficult and beyond the scope of this lesson.</p>

<p>We can use the Ising model to study the liquid-gas phase transitions. In this case case, we just think of spin as representing whether a given spot on the lattice is occupied. A given spot <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is occupied if <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_i=1\)</span> and not occupied if <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_i=-1\)</span>. The external field <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> corresponds to the chemical potential <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. In fact it’s the chemical potential relative to chemical equilibrium, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(h=\mu-\mu_{eq}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For gases it’s more insightful to re-write spins in terms of particle densities. We can transform the spins <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> to densities <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> via the formula <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 2n-1\)</span>. This ensures <span class="math inline">\(n=0,1\)</span> corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = -1,+1\)</span>. In terms of densities the Hamiltonian becomes <span class="math display">\[
H = -4J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} n_i n_j - (\mu-\mu_{eq}) \sum_{i=1}^N n_i \ .
\]</span> It’s not hard to show that the density equivalent of magnetization, call it <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>, transforms the same way as the spin, <span class="math inline">\(m = 2\nu - 1\)</span>. This means the qualitative behavior of the liquid-gas phase transition is the same in this model except with the values slightly rescaled. For example, the <span class="math inline">\(\tanh\)</span> function converts into a <em>sigmoid</em> function scaled between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(\mu=\mu_{eq}\)</span> the gas is at chemical equilibrium, which is precisely when phase transitions can occur. As <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> deviates ever so slightly from <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{eq}\)</span> the phase transition phenomenon disappears as the gas stays in either its gas or liquid phase depending on the sign of <span class="math inline">\(\mu-\mu_{eq}\)</span>.</p>

<section id="critical-behavior" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critical-behavior">Critical Behavior</h2>
<p>We’ll close this chapter by briefly studying the behavior of systems near the critical point. It turns out that the behavior of gases near the critical point is in some sense <em>universal</em>, in that certain quantities are the same no matter which gas is studied.</p>
<section id="corresponding-states" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="corresponding-states">Corresponding States</h3>
<p>Let’s go back to the van der Waals equation. Recall the critical points are given by the following equations, <span class="math display">\[
k_B T_c = \frac{8a}{27b} , \qquad v_c = 3b , \qquad P_c = \frac{a}{27b^2} \ .
\]</span></p>
<p>Here we’ve expressed things in terms of the volume per particle <span class="math inline">\(v \equiv \frac{V}{N}\)</span> to keep everything intensive. We’ll re-express the van der Waals equation in dimensionless form by defining <span class="math display">\[
\tilde P \equiv \frac{P}{P_c}, \qquad \tilde T \equiv \frac{T}{T_c}, \qquad \tilde v \equiv \frac{v}{v_c} \ .
\]</span> With these variables we can write the equation in a universal form that doesn’t depend on which gas we’re talking about. It’s sometimes called the <em>law of corresponding states</em>, given by <span class="math display">\[
\tilde P = \frac{8}{3} \frac{\tilde T}{\tilde v - \frac{1}{3}} - \frac{3}{\tilde v^2} \ .
\]</span> First, notice the quantity <span class="math display">\[
\frac{P_c v_c}{k_B T_c} = \frac{8}{3} = 0.375
\]</span> doesn’t depend on <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. It seems to be some kind of universal constant for all gases, at least to the extent the above equation is correct. In fact this ratio isn’t right for real gases. It’s slightly too high. Real values tend to be in the range of <span class="math inline">\(0.25\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.3\)</span>. Given that the van der Waals equation is only accurate for fairly dilute gases this discrepancy shouldn’t be that surprising.</p>
</section>
<section id="critical-exponents" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critical-exponents">Critical Exponents</h3>
<p>We’ll look briefly at the behavior of three different quantities to get an idea how a gas behaves near the critical point:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The behavior of pressure as a function of volume.</li>
<li>The behavior of the coexistence volume difference as a function of temperature.</li>
<li>The behavior of the compressibility as a function of temperature.</li>
</ol>
<p>First, let’s get an idea how the pressure depends on volume near the critical point. Recall that thermodynamic stability requires that the pressure <span class="math inline">\(P(V)\)</span> along the critical isotherm has no first or second order volume dependence, meaning <span class="math inline">\(P(v) = O(v^3)\)</span>. It’s worth asking if pressure in fact has a third order dependence rather than a fifth or odd higher order dependence. At least according to the van der Waals equation there does indeed seems to be a third order dependence. Near the critical point we can Taylor expand the equation and write <span class="math display">\[
P-P_c \sim (v-v_c)^3 \ .
\]</span> What’s important here is the prediction that pressure depends on volume to the <em>third power</em> near the critical point. Again, it’s fair to ask if this is exactly true for real gases, and again it turns out the answer is not quite. The true relationship is more like <span class="math inline">\(P-P_c \sim (v-v_c)^{\delta}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\delta \approx 4.8\)</span>. That is, the real critical isotherm is almost a quintic near the critical point, not a cubic.</p>
<p>Second, let’s look at how the volume difference <span class="math inline">\(\delta v = v_{gas}-v_{liq}\)</span> depends on the temperature near the critical point. We expect <span class="math inline">\(\delta v\)</span> to shrink to zero as <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> approaches <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>, since that must happen for the coexistence behavior to cease. But how fast does it shrink? When <span class="math inline">\(T &lt; T_c\)</span> the van der Waals equation must have two stable solutions to <span class="math inline">\(P(v)\)</span>, one with <span class="math inline">\(v_{liq}\)</span> and the other with <span class="math inline">\(v_{gas}\)</span>. In dimensionless form, this means <span class="math display">\[
\tilde P = \frac{8}{3} \frac{\tilde T}{\tilde v_{liq} - \frac{1}{3}} - \frac{3}{\tilde v_{liq}^2} = \frac{8}{3} \frac{\tilde T}{\tilde v_{gas} - \frac{1}{3}} - \frac{3}{\tilde v_{gas}^2} \ .
\]</span> Solving the equation for <span class="math inline">\(\tilde T\)</span> and Taylor expanding in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\delta v\)</span>, we can then write <span class="math display">\[
\tilde T = \frac{(3v_{liq}-1)(3v_{gas}-1)(v_{liq} + v_{gas})}{8v_{liq}^2 v_{gas}^2} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{16} \delta v^2 + \cdots \ .
\]</span> Evidently then the temperature near the critical point goes like the velocity difference <em>squared</em>, or inverting, <span class="math display">\[
\delta v \sim (T-T_c)^{1/2} \ .
\]</span> This dependence doesn’t depend on the type of gas under consideration. But is this relationship exact for real gases? Again, not quite. Experimentally, it turns out that <span class="math inline">\(\delta v \sim (T-T_c)^{\beta}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\beta \approx 0.32\)</span>.</p>
<p>Third, let’s ask how the compressibility <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> depends on the temperature near the critical point. We can express <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[
\kappa = -\frac{1}{v} \frac{\partial v}{\partial P} \bigg |_T \ .
\]</span> As <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow T_c\)</span> we must have that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial P}{\partial v} \rightarrow 0\)</span> to be at the critical point. We’d thus expect that the compressibility of a gas <em>diverges</em> at the critical point. Applying the smallest amount of pressure should change the volume a huge amount as the gas undergoes a phase transition. If we expand <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial P}{\partial v}\)</span> in powers of <span class="math inline">\(T-T_c\)</span> we expect to get <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial P}{\partial v} = -a(T-T_c) + \cdots \ .
\]</span> Inverting this equation when <span class="math inline">\(T \approx T_c\)</span>, this then says <span class="math display">\[
\kappa \sim (T-T_c)^{-1} \ .
\]</span> Again, this dependence is apparently independent of the gas. And again, it’s fair to ask if this dependence is truly correct for real gases. As we’d expect by now, it’s not exactly correct. The true relationship is <span class="math inline">\(\kappa \sim (T-T_c)^{-\gamma}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \approx 1.2\)</span>.</p>
<p>These interesting exponent relationships seem to apply to all gases, at least near the critical point. The exponents themselves are called <strong>critical exponents</strong>. They’re <em>universal</em>. In fact, they apply to even more than gases. The results obtained even apply to the Ising Model when <span class="math inline">\(d=3\)</span>. In that case we’d just replace the volume <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> with the average spin <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the pressure <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> with the external field <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, and the compressibility <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> with the <em>susceptibility</em> <span class="math inline">\(\chi \equiv N\frac{\partial m}{\partial h} \big |_T\)</span>. All of the previous results can be obtained in an analogous manner to give the critical relations <span class="math display">\[
h \sim m^3, \qquad m_0 \sim \pm (T-T_c)^{1/2}, \qquad \chi \sim (T-T_c)^{-1} \ .
\]</span> But why aren’t these results exact? After all the real critical exponents are slightly off in all cases. Fundamentally, the issue is that we’re trying to do an analytic expansion of an equation of state about the critical point. But we can’t really do that since there’s a discontinuity at the critical point, which is what leads to phase transitions. To get more accurate estimates of the critical exponents we should approach the problem in a very different way, using more advanced techniques like group renormalization. This gets into the more modern topic of <em>critical phenomena</em>, something we’ll see more in future lessons.</p>
