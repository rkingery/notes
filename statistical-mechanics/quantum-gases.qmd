# Quantum Gases

In this chapter we'll apply the theory of quantum statistical mechanics to the study of real gases. Particularly, we'll study the behavior of gases of identical particles in both the high and low temperature limits. In the high temperature limit we'll see we recover classical gas behavior. But in the low temperature limit interesting quantum effects happen. The behavior of a low temperature gas will depend primarily on whether the gas is composed of fermions of bosons. The theory of Fermi gases leads to behaviors like Fermi pressure and the Curie point, while the theory of Bose gases leads to behaviors like Bose-Einstein condensation.

## Identical Particles

Recall the distinction we made in classical statistical mechanics between *distinguishable particles* and *identical particles*. A collection of particles was distinguishable if we could label each particle and in principle tell them apart. They were identical if this wasn't true, if there was no way even in principle to tell apart one particle from another. We found it was very easy to account for this fact in classical statistical mechanics. If $N$ particles were identical, we just needed to be sure to divide the partition function by $N!$ to account for all possible permutations of those particles.

In quantum mechanics, the nature of identical particles is baked deep into the theory itself. There's nothing arbitrary about them, since in quantum mechanics there really is no way even in principle to label a tiny particle without changing its state. Every fundamental particle is identical. From a theoretical perspective, identical particles arise due to the *exchange postulate*. Consider two particles. Suppose $|\psi \rangle$ is the state of particle one, and $|\phi \rangle$ is the state of particle two. Then we should expect the joint state where both of these occur is given by the *tensor product* of the two, namely $|\psi \rangle |\phi \rangle \equiv |\psi \rangle \otimes |\phi \rangle$. The exchange postulate states that the only tensor product states allowed for real particles are those that are eigenvectors of the *exchange operator* $P_\sigma$ defined by the relation
$$
P_\sigma |\psi \rangle |\phi \rangle \equiv |\phi \rangle |\psi \rangle \ .
$$
Since exchange two particles twice gives the original state back, we must have $P_\sigma^2 = 1$, meaning its eigenvalues must be $\eta \equiv \pm 1$. Calling these eigenvectors $|\Psi\rangle_\eta$, this means
$$
P_\sigma |\Psi\rangle_\eta = \eta |\Psi\rangle_\eta \ .
$$
Any tensor product state of two particles must be one of these two eigenstates. It's easy to see that these eigenstates are just the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the tensor product state,
$$
\begin{align*}
|\Psi\rangle_{+} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(|\psi \rangle |\phi \rangle + |\phi \rangle |\psi \rangle \big) \ , \\
|\Psi\rangle_{-} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(|\psi \rangle |\phi \rangle - |\phi \rangle |\psi \rangle \big) \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Particles whose exchange eigenstates are $|\Psi\rangle_{+}$ are called **bosons**, while particles whose exchange eigenstates are $|\Psi\rangle_{-}$ are called **fermions**. Notice that fermions satisfy the important condition that both particles can never been in the same state, since then we'd have $|\Psi\rangle_{-} = 0$, a non-normalizable state. This is a general reflection of the *Pauli exclusion principle*, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same state. They must always be distinct. Bosons, however, don't have to satisfy the exclusion principle. This one distinction makes the behavior of bosons and fermions very different from each other.

But how do we know which of the two eigenstates a given pair of particles should have? It turns out this comes down to their *spin*. If each particle has *integer* total spin, then that particle is a *boson*. If each particle instead has *half-integer* total spin, then that particle is a *fermion*. This fact is consequence of the *spin-statistics theorem*, an important theorem of relativistic quantum field theory. We won't bother to prove it here. Electrons are the canonical example of fermions, with spin $1/2$. Photons are the canonical example of bosons, with spin $1$. There are many more of each of course. In fact all particles in nature can be broken down into these two classes depending on whether they have integer or half-integer total spin.

This is all true for two particle systems, but in statistical mechanics we're interested in $N$-particle systems, where $N$ is typically a huge number. We'll just state the result for $N$-particle systems of bosons or fermions without proving anything. 

Let $P_\sigma$ be the permutation operator that permutes the indexes $1, 2, \cdots, N$ to some permutation $\sigma(1), \sigma(2), \cdots, \sigma(N)$. There will generally be $N!$ such permutations. For a set of $N$ *bosons*, we have
$$
|\Psi\rangle_{+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{+}}} \sum_\sigma P_\sigma | \psi_1 \rangle | \psi_2 \rangle \cdots | \psi_N \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{+}}} \sum_\sigma | \psi_{\sigma(1)} \rangle | \psi_{\sigma(2)} \rangle \cdots | \psi_{\sigma(N)} \rangle \ .
$$
For a set of $N$ *fermions*, we have
$$
|\Psi\rangle_{-} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{-}}} \sum_\sigma (-1)^{p(\sigma)} P_\sigma | \psi_1 \rangle | \psi_2 \rangle \cdots | \psi_N \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{-}}} \sum_\sigma (-1)^{p(\sigma)} | \psi_{\sigma(1)} \rangle | \psi_{\sigma(2)} \rangle \cdots | \psi_{\sigma(N)} \rangle \ .
$$
Here $p(\sigma)$ denotes the *parity* of the permutation $\sigma$. For *even* permutations $p(\sigma)$ is some even number, meaning $(-1)^{p(\sigma)} = 1$. For  *odd* permutations $p(\sigma)$ is some odd number, meaning $(-1)^\sigma = -1$.

It's easy to see that we can combine both equations into one by using $\eta = \pm 1$ to write
$$
\boxed{
|\Psi\rangle_\eta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_\eta}} \sum_\sigma \eta^{p(\sigma)} P_\sigma | \psi_1 \rangle | \psi_2 \rangle \cdots | \psi_N \rangle
} \ .
$$
The factors $N_\eta$ are whatever normalization factors are needed so that $\langle\Psi|\Psi\rangle_\eta=1$. Intuitively, we'd expect that $N_\eta = N!$ given there are $N!$ permutations. This is true for *fermions* provided we insist all states $\psi_k$ be unique to satisfy the exclusion principle. That is, $N_{-} = N!$ for fermions, provided the sum is over distinct states only. 

However, for bosons taking $N_{+} = N!$ would mean we're overcounting due to the fact that some of the states in the sum are equivalent. To correct for this, we also have to divide by $\prod_k n_k!$, where $n_k$ is the number of particles in state $\psi_k$. To see why this is true, take the case of 3 bosons. Symmetrizing we'd have
$$
|\psi_1 \psi_2 \psi_3 \rangle_{+} = \mathcal{N} \big(|\psi_1 \psi_2 \psi_3 \rangle + |\psi_2 \psi_3 \psi_1 \rangle + |\psi_1 \psi_3 \psi_2 \rangle + |\psi_2 \psi_1 \psi_3 \rangle + |\psi_3 \psi_2 \psi_1 \rangle + |\psi_3 \psi_1 \psi_2 \rangle\big) \ ,
$$
where $\mathcal{N}$ is whatever normalization constant is needed so that $\langle \psi_1 \psi_2 \psi_3 | \psi_1 \psi_2 \psi_3 \rangle_{+} = 1$. In this case, it's clear we have $\mathcal{N}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}$. Now suppose two of the states are the same, say $\psi_1=\psi_2$. Then the above sum reduces to
$$
\begin{align*}
|\psi_1 \psi_1 \psi_3 \rangle_{+} &= \mathcal{N} \big(|\psi_1 \psi_1 \psi_3 \rangle + |\psi_1 \psi_3 \psi_1 \rangle + |\psi_1 \psi_3 \psi_1 \rangle + |\psi_1 \psi_1 \psi_3 \rangle + |\psi_3 \psi_1 \psi_1 \rangle + |\psi_3 \psi_1 \psi_1 \rangle\big) \\
&= 2\mathcal{N} \big(|\psi_1 \psi_1 \psi_3 \rangle + |\psi_1 \psi_3 \psi_1 \rangle + |\psi_3 \psi_1 \psi_1 \rangle\big) \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \big(|\psi_1 \psi_1 \psi_3 \rangle + |\psi_1 \psi_3 \psi_1 \rangle + |\psi_3 \psi_1 \psi_1 \rangle\big) \ .
\end{align*}
$$
For this sum to normalize properly, we'd instead need to take $\mathcal{N} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3!2!1!}}$, which means $N_{+} = N! \prod n_k!$. The set $\{n_k\}$ of all such $n_k$ are called *occupation numbers* since they represent the number of particles that occupy a given state.

For bosons, each particle can occupy whichever states it likes. All we require is that the total number of bosons stay conserved. This means bosons should satisfy the constraint $\sum_k n_k = N$. We can think of occupation numbers as applying to fermions too. In that case, the exclusion principle requires each $n_k=0,1$ only. They should still satisfy the constraint $\sum_k n_k = N$. This means we can streamline notation if we like and express the normalization constant in both cases by
$$
N_\eta \equiv N! \prod_k n_k! \ .
$$
It turns out we can even use occupation numbers to characterize the *states* of identical particles as well. Instead of representing $|\Psi\rangle_\eta$ as a combination of product states $| \psi_1 \rangle | \psi_2 \rangle \cdots | \psi_N \rangle$, we could represent the state $|\Psi\rangle_\eta$ by indicating what the occupation numbers are for each state $\psi_k$. That is, $|\Psi\rangle_\eta = \big|\{n_k\} \big\rangle$.

For example, if all states are distinct we could represent $|\psi_1 \psi_2 \psi_3 \rangle_{+}$ by the ket $|1,1,1 \rangle$. If exactly two of the three states are equal, say $\psi_1=\psi_2 \neq \psi_3$ then we could represent the state by $|\psi_1 \psi_2 \psi_3 \rangle_{+} \equiv |2,1 \rangle$. In both cases each ket sums to the total particle number. This representation of a joint state is called a *Fock space* representation. Fock space representations of identical particles are often nice since we avoid the need to explicitly sum over all valid permutations.

## Quantum Ideal Gas

With a discussion of identical particles out of the way we can now attempt to give a proper treatment to the quantum ideal gas. Recall in our prior treatment of the quantum ideal gas we had to assume all particles were distinguishable. In quantum mechanics this is generally forbidden, since even in principle we can't imagine labeling any small particles without violating the uncertainty principle. We'll now attempt to find the partition function for the quantum mechanical gas of identical particles. Since there is more subtlety involved in the quantum case than in the classical case, we'll derive the partition function in two different representations, starting with the position representation.

### Position Representation

Rather than calculate the partition function $Z$ directly, we'll start by finding the density matrix in the position representation. Recall for a single non-interacting particle in a box of volume $V \gg \lambda_T^3$ we derived the formula
$$
\langle \mathbf{x} | \rho_1 | \mathbf{x}' \rangle = \frac{1}{V} \exp\bigg(-\frac{(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')^2}{\lambda_T^2 / \pi} \bigg) \ .
$$
We'll now attempt to derive a formula for the density matrix $\big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | \rho_1 | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle_\eta$ of $N$ non-interacting particles in a box. The Hamiltonian is then $H = \sum \frac{\mathbf{p}_i^2}{2m}$, which again means the basis of wavevector kets $\big|\{\mathbf{k}\} \big\rangle$ diagonalizes the $H$, with
$$
H \big|\{\mathbf{k}\} \big\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\hbar^2 \mathbf{k}_i^2}{2m} \big|\{\mathbf{k}\} \big\rangle \ .
$$
Inserting two resolutions of the identity over both $\{\mathbf{k}\}$ and $\{\mathbf{k}'\}$ and simplifying, we have
$$
\begin{align*}
\big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | \rho | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle_\eta &= \sideset{}{'}\sum_{\{\mathbf{k}\}} \sideset{}{'}\sum_{\{\mathbf{k}'\}} \big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | \{\mathbf{k}\} \big\rangle_\eta \ \big\langle\{\mathbf{k}\} |\rho| \{\mathbf{k}'\} \big\rangle \ \big\langle\{\mathbf{k}'\} | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle_\eta \\
&= \frac{1}{Z}\sideset{}{'}\sum_{\{\mathbf{k}\}} \sideset{}{'}\sum_{\{\mathbf{k}'\}} \exp\bigg(-\frac{\beta\hbar^2}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^N \mathbf{k}_j^2 \bigg) \big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | \{\mathbf{k}\} \big\rangle_\eta \ \big\langle\{\mathbf{k}\} | \{\mathbf{k}'\} \big\rangle \ \big\langle\{\mathbf{k}'\} | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle_\eta \\
&= \frac{1}{Z}\sideset{}{'}\sum_{\{\mathbf{k}\}} \exp\bigg(-\frac{\beta\hbar^2}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^N \mathbf{k}_j^2 \bigg) \big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | \{\mathbf{k}\} \big\rangle_\eta \ \big\langle\{\mathbf{k}\} | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle_\eta  \ .\\
\end{align*}
$$
Note the use of the restricted sum here. We're constrained by the fact that there must be exactly $N$ particles in the box, whether for fermions or bosons. To get rid of the constraint we just need to figure out how much we're overcounting by in the sum. It turns out that overcounting factor is just $\prod_{\mathbf{k}} n_{\mathbf{k}}! / N!$, so we can just do the substitution
$$
\sideset{}{'}\sum_{\{\mathbf{k}\}} \rightarrow \sum_{\{\mathbf{k}\}} \frac{\prod_{\mathbf{k}} n_{\mathbf{k}}!}{N!} \ .
$$
We also need to make sure to sum over all permutations for each term $\big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | \{\mathbf{k}\} \big\rangle_\eta$ and $\big\langle\{\mathbf{k}\} | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle_\eta$. This will give a double sum over permutations with different parities $p$ and $p'$, contributing a normalization factor $N_\eta = N! \prod_{\mathbf{k}} n_{\mathbf{k}}!$ that fortunately happens to cancel the $\prod_{\mathbf{k}} n_{\mathbf{k}}!$ prefactor from the constrained sum,
$$
\begin{align*}
\big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | \rho | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle_\eta &= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\{\mathbf{k}\}} \frac{\prod_{\mathbf{k}} n_{\mathbf{k}}!}{N!} \exp\bigg(-\frac{\beta\hbar^2}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^N \mathbf{k}_j^2 \bigg) \big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | \{\mathbf{k}\} \big\rangle_\eta \ \big\langle\{\mathbf{k}\} | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle_\eta \\
&= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\{\mathbf{k}\}} \frac{\prod_{\mathbf{k}} n_{\mathbf{k}}!}{N!} \exp\bigg(-\frac{\beta\hbar^2}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^N \mathbf{k}_j^2 \bigg) \sum_{\sigma,\sigma'} \frac{\eta^p \eta^{p'}}{N! \prod_{\mathbf{k}} n_{\mathbf{k}}!} \big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | P_\sigma \{\mathbf{k}\} \big\rangle \ \big\langle P_{\sigma'} \{\mathbf{k}\} | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle \\
&= \frac{1}{Z(N!)^2} \sum_{\sigma,\sigma'} \eta^p \eta^{p'} \sum_{\{\mathbf{k}\}} \exp\bigg(-\frac{\beta\hbar^2}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^N \mathbf{k}_j^2 \bigg) \big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | P_\sigma \{\mathbf{k}\} \big\rangle \ \big\langle P_{\sigma'} \{\mathbf{k}\} | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle \ .\\
\end{align*}
$$
We'll now use the usual density of states approximation for the sums over all $\{\mathbf{k}\}$. This of course assumes $V \gg \lambda_T^3$ so that particle quantum interactions are relatively weak. Replacing the sum by an integral, and using the fact that $\big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | P_\sigma \{\mathbf{k}\} \big\rangle$ is just the Fourier transform weighting factor in $3N$ dimensions, we have
$$
\big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | \rho | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle_\eta
\approx \frac{1}{Z(N!)^2} \sum_{\sigma,\sigma'} \eta^p \eta^{p'} \int \frac{d^{3N}\mathbf{k}}{(2\pi)^{3N}} \exp\bigg[\sum_{j=1}^N \bigg(-\frac{\beta\hbar^2}{2m}\mathbf{k}_j^2 + i\big(\mathbf{k}_{\sigma(j)} \cdot \mathbf{x}_j - \mathbf{k}_{\sigma'(j)} \cdot \mathbf{x}'_j\big) \bigg)\bigg] \ .
$$
This integral seems like another Gaussian integral, but we have to be careful here since the integration variables are over $\{\mathbf{k}\}$ and not $P_\sigma \{\mathbf{k}\}$ or $P_{\sigma'} \{\mathbf{k}\}$. We can move the permutations onto the position vectors instead by simply inverting them to get
$$
\begin{align*}
\big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | \rho | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle_\eta
&= \frac{1}{Z(N!)^2} \sum_{\sigma,\sigma'} \eta^p \eta^{p'} \int \frac{d^{3N}\mathbf{k}}{(2\pi)^{3N}} \ \exp\bigg[\sum_{j=1}^N \bigg(-\frac{\beta\hbar^2}{2m}\mathbf{k}_j^2 + i\big(\mathbf{k}_j \cdot \mathbf{x}_{\sigma^{-1}(j)} - \mathbf{k}_j \cdot \mathbf{x}'_{\sigma'^{-1}(j)}\big) \bigg)\bigg] \\
&= \frac{1}{Z(N!)^2} \sum_{\sigma,\sigma'} \eta^p \eta^{p'} \prod_{j=1}^N \int \frac{d^{3}\mathbf{k}_j}{(2\pi)^{3N}} \ \exp\bigg[-\frac{\beta\hbar^2}{2m}\mathbf{k}_j^2 + i \mathbf{k}_j \cdot \big(\mathbf{x}_{\sigma^{-1}(j)} - \mathbf{x}'_{\sigma'^{-1}(j)}\big)\bigg] \\
&= \frac{1}{Z(N!)^2} \sum_{\sigma,\sigma'} \eta^p \eta^{p'} \prod_{j=1}^N \bigg(\frac{1}{\lambda_T^3} \exp\bigg[-\frac{(\mathbf{x}_{\sigma^{-1}(j)} - \mathbf{x}'_{\sigma'^{-1}(j)})^2}{\lambda_T^2/\pi}\bigg] \bigg) \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Now, we can use the fact that the two permutations are now redundant by rewriting the double sum as a free sum over all $N!$ permutations plus a sum over the relative permutations $Q \equiv P'^{-1}P$ to get
$$
\big\langle \{\mathbf{x}\} | \rho | \{\mathbf{x}'\} \big\rangle_\eta = \frac{1}{ZN!\lambda_T^{3N}} \sum_\tau \eta^q \exp\bigg[-\sum_{j=1}^N\frac{(\mathbf{x}_j - \mathbf{x}'_{\tau(j)})^2}{\lambda_T^2/\pi}\bigg] \ .
$$
Finally, to get the partition function, we can use the relation $\text{tr } \rho = 1$ and solve for $Z$ by integrating over all $\{\mathbf{x}\}$ to get
$$
\boxed{
Z = \frac{1}{N!\lambda_T^{3N}} \int d^{3N} \mathbf{x} \ \sum_\tau \eta^q \exp\bigg[-\sum_{j=1}^N\frac{(\mathbf{x}_j - \mathbf{x}_{\tau(j)})^2}{\lambda_T^2/\pi}\bigg]
} \ .
$$
It's hard to parse what this is saying as is. To make it easier to analyze let's write out the permutations in order of increasing parity. The zero-parity term involves no permutations at all, that is $Q=1$. In that case the exponential vanishes to give $V^N$, which implies $Z \approx \frac{1}{N!} \big(\frac{V}{\lambda_T^3})^N$. This is just the partition function for the classical ideal gas. We can also see right off where that $N!$ term for identical particles came from in classical statistical mechanics. It falls right out of the quantum theory.

The next permutations involve one-parity terms of pairwise swaps. In this case, all but two of the exponentials vanish, giving a factor of $V^{N-2}$. The remaining two terms we can convert to relative coordinates and integrate out another factor of $V$. Since there are $\binom{N}{2} = \frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ such terms, we get
$$
Z \approx \frac{V^N}{N!\lambda_T^{3N}} \bigg(1 + \frac{N^2}{2V} \int d^3 \boldsymbol{x} \ \eta e^{- 2\pi r^2 / \lambda_T^2} \bigg) \approx \frac{V^N}{N!\lambda_T^{3N}} \bigg[1 + \frac{\eta N^2}{2V} \bigg(\frac{\lambda_T^2}{2}\bigg)^{3/2} + O\bigg(\frac{N^3}{V^2}\bigg)\bigg] \ .
$$
To see what's going on let's calculate the pressure. Letting $n=\frac{N}{V}$ be the density, the expression for $\beta P$ is evidently
$$
\beta P = \frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial V} = n - \frac{\eta}{2} \bigg(\frac{\lambda_T^2}{2}\bigg)^{3/2} n^2 + O(n^3) \ .
$$
This is clearly a virial expansion in terms of some kind of interaction potential $u(r)$. The second virial coefficient in this case is
$$
B_2(T) = -\frac{\eta}{2} \bigg(\frac{\lambda_T^2}{2}\bigg)^{3/2} \ .
$$
For bosons this coefficient is negative, meaning the pressure is *reduced* from that of the classical ideal gas due to bosonic attraction. For fermions the opposite is true, meaning the pressure is *increased* due to fermionic repulsion. As $T$ increases these effects become less and less important since $\lambda_T \rightarrow 0$, becoming essentially negligible in the classical limit.

Now, recall from our discussion of classically interacting gases that virial expansions can be thought of as arising from a cluster expansion in terms of powers of the Mayer f-function $f(r) \equiv e^{-\beta u(r)}-1$. This means we can think of the above expansion as arising from the presence of an effective potential $u(r) = -k_B T \log (1 + f(r))$. In our case we can read off from the expansion for $Z$ that $f(r) = e^{-2\pi r^2 / \lambda_T^2}$, hence we have
$$
u(r) \approx - k_B T \log\big( 1 + \eta e^{-2\pi r^2 / \lambda_T^2}\big) \ .
$$
This effective potential $u(r)$ arises purely from the quantum mechanical behavior of identical particles, even if we assume they're completely non-interacting as we would for the ideal gas. If we plot $u(r)$ for $\eta = \pm 1$ we get two potential curves like the ones shown in the following figure.

![](./resources/image-20231014133317922.png){fig-align=center width=400}

For fermions, $u(r)$ goes to zero exponentially fast as $r \rightarrow \infty$ and blows up as $r \rightarrow 0$. This reflects the exclusion principle, which essentially forbids fermions from getting too close to each other. As the particles get farther apart this fermionic repulsion dies off exponentially fast. 

For bosons, $u(r)$ still dies off exponentially fast as $r \rightarrow \infty$, except now from below due to the attractive nature of bosons. Instead of blowing up as $r \rightarrow 0$ we instead get a finite value of $u(0) \approx -k_B T \log 2$. The shape of this curve represents the fact that bosons prefer to be in the same state, yet they only feel this effect when very close to each other.

Of course, this only a valid potential when the density is sufficiently small. For denser gases we'd need to include higher order corrections arising from multi-body quantum exchange interactions. This further complicates what the potential for identical particles looks like, but the rough idea is basically the same. Qualitatively speaking, bosons attract, while fermions repel.

### Energy Representation

While insightful, it's pretty clear that the position representation is an unnatural way to compute the partition function for an ideal gas. We've already seen that the natural basis for this is the basis of wavevector states $|\{\mathbf{k}\}\rangle$. In this basis, we have


$$
Z = \text{tr} \ e^{-\beta H} = \sideset{}{'}\sum_{\{\mathbf{k}\}} \langle \{\mathbf{k}\} | e^{-\beta \sum_{i=1}^N \varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}_i}} | \{\mathbf{k}\} \rangle_\eta \ ,
$$

where we've introduced the shorthand $\varepsilon_\mathbf{k}$ to refer to the energy eigenvalue of a given particle with wavevector $\mathbf{k}$. In the usual case of an ideal non-relativistic particle in a box, we'd have $\varepsilon_\mathbf{k} = \frac{\hbar^2 \mathbf{k}^2}{2m}$. But in other cases it may differ. For example, we could also be describing a gas of *ultra-relativistic* particles in a box, where we'd have $\varepsilon_\mathbf{k} = \hbar c |\mathbf{k}|$.

Again we're dealing with a constrained sum due to the requirement that $N = \sum n_\mathbf{k}$. Rather than write out the permutations explicitly as we did before, let's instead work in Fock space this time by setting $| \{\mathbf{k}\} \rangle_\eta = | \{n_\mathbf{k}\} \rangle$. We then have
$$
Z = \sideset{}{'}\sum_{\{n_\mathbf{k}\}} \langle \{n_\mathbf{k}\} | e^{-\beta \sum_\mathbf{k} n_\mathbf{k} \varepsilon_\mathbf{k}} | \{n_\mathbf{k}\} \rangle = \sideset{}{'}\sum_{\{n_\mathbf{k}\}} e^{-\beta \sum_\mathbf{k} n_\mathbf{k} \varepsilon_\mathbf{k}} \ .
$$
Of course, we still haven't removed the constraint. To do that we'll use a trick we've seen before. Namely, we'll switch to the grand canonical formulation where $N$ is allowed to take on any positive integer. Doing that removes the constraint, giving
$$
\mathcal{Z} = \sum_{N=0}^\infty e^{\beta\mu N} Z = \sum_{\{n_\mathbf{k}\}} e^{\beta\mu \sum_\mathbf{k} n_\mathbf{k}} e^{-\beta \sum_\mathbf{k} n_\mathbf{k} \varepsilon_\mathbf{k}} = \prod_\mathbf{k} \sum_{n_\mathbf{k}} e^{-\beta n_\mathbf{k}\big(\varepsilon_\mathbf{k} - \mu\big)} \ .
$$
Now, to do the sum over $n_\mathbf{k}$ we have to distinguish between the case for bosons and fermions. For fermions $n_\mathbf{k}=0,1$, which means we're just summing two terms. For bosons $n_\mathbf{k}=0,1,\cdots$, which gives a geometric series. We can combine both expressions into one by writing
$$
\mathcal{Z}_\eta = \prod_\mathbf{k} \bigg(1 + \eta e^{-\beta \big(\varepsilon_\mathbf{k} - \mu\big)}\bigg)^{-\eta} \ .
$$
This means the log grand partition function is given by
$$
\log\mathcal{Z}_\eta = -\eta \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \log \bigg(1 + \eta e^{-\beta \big(\varepsilon_\mathbf{k} - \mu\big)}\bigg) \ .
$$


### Quantum Distributions

As is typical with the grand canonical formulation, one of the first things we want to do is calculate $N$. Since the sum over all occupation numbers must equal $N$, we have
$$
N = \frac{\partial \log\mathcal{Z}_\eta}{\partial (\beta\mu)} = -\eta \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \frac{\partial}{\partial(\beta\mu)} \log \bigg(1 + \eta e^{-\beta \big(\varepsilon_\mathbf{k} - \mu\big)}\bigg)  = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \frac{1}{e^{\beta(\varepsilon_\mathbf{k}-\mu)} - \eta} = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \langle n_\mathbf{k} \rangle \ .
$$
Evidently then, the mean occupation numbers are given by the formula
$$
\boxed{
\langle n_\mathbf{k} \rangle = \frac{1}{e^{\beta(\varepsilon_\mathbf{k}-\mu)} - \eta}
} \ .
$$
This formula defines two distributions describing how many particles we can expect to occupy a given state when those particles are identical. For *bosons* this distribution is called the **Bose-Einstein distribution**, given by
$$
\langle n_\mathbf{k} \rangle = \frac{1}{e^{\beta(\varepsilon_\mathbf{k}-\mu)} - 1} \ ,
$$
while for *fermions* the distribution is called the **Fermi-Dirac distribution**, given by
$$
\langle n_\mathbf{k} \rangle = \frac{1}{e^{\beta(\varepsilon_\mathbf{k}-\mu)} + 1} \ .
$$
In the dilute limit we expect each $\langle n \rangle \ll 1$, which means $e^{\beta(\varepsilon-\mu)} \gg 1$. In that limit, both distributions reduce to the classical distribution we expect for a particle of energy $\varepsilon$, namely the **Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution** given by
$$
\langle n_\mathbf{k} \rangle = e^{-\beta(\varepsilon_\mathbf{k}-\mu)} \ .
$$
We have seen how the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution behaves already when we studied classical statistical mechanics. In the next few sections we'll focus on the study of the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions and their implications.

### Equations of State

Now that we have the partition function we can proceed to calculate the equations of state for the quantum ideal gas. We'll again assume that $V \gg \lambda_T^3$ so that we can use the density of states to rewrite the log partition function as
$$
\log\mathcal{Z}_\eta \approx -\eta\frac{g V}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3 \mathbf{k} \  \log \bigg(1 + \eta e^{-\beta \big(\varepsilon_\mathbf{k} - \mu\big)}\bigg) \ .
$$

Notice we've now introduced a factor $g$ in the density of state conversion. This constant is there to reflect the fact that at the quantum level particles also contain a *spin* state $s$, which gives an extra $g=s(s+1)$ degeneracy to each state. For example, for spin-half fermions like electrons we'd have $s=\frac{1}{2}$ and hence $g=2$.

From here on we'll again assume the energy states $\varepsilon_\mathbf{k}$ are those for the particle in the box, $\varepsilon_\mathbf{k} = \frac{\hbar^2\mathbf{k}^2}{2m}$. Let's first calculate the expected particle number $N$, or more conveniently the number density $n \approx \frac{N}{V}$. Plugging in this choice of $\varepsilon_\mathbf{k}$ and using the density of states conversion along with the fact that the integral is spherically symmetric, we have
$$
n = \frac{1}{V} \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \langle n_\mathbf{k} \rangle
\approx \frac{g}{(2\pi)^3} \int_0^\infty 4\pi k^2 dk \ \frac{1}{e^{-\beta\mu} e^{\beta\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}} - \eta} \ .
$$
Here it benefits to perform a change of variables. First we'll reintroduce the **fugacity** $z \equiv e^{\beta\mu}$ to provide a more convenient variable to tune than the chemical potential $\mu$. Next we'll use thermal deBroglie wavelength $\lambda_T = \frac{h}{(2\pi m k_B T)^{1/2}}$ to rewrite the expression $\frac{\beta\hbar^2}{m} = \frac{\lambda_T^2}{2\pi}$. Last, we'll define a change of variable from $k$ to a new variable $x$ defined by
$$
x \equiv \frac{\beta\hbar^2}{2m} k^2 = \frac{\lambda_T^2}{4\pi} k^2 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad
\begin{cases}
k = \frac{2\pi^{1/2}}{\lambda_T} x^{1/2} \\
dk = \frac{\pi^{1/2}}{\lambda_T} x^{-1/2} dx \\
\end{cases} \ .
$$
Plugging each of these expressions back into the integral and simplifying, we get
$$
n = \frac{g}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{(2\pi^{1/2})^5}{2\lambda_T^3} \int_0^\infty dx \ \frac{x^{1/2}}{z^{-1} e^{x} - \eta} = \frac{g}{\lambda_T^3} \frac{1}{(1/2)!} \int_0^\infty dx \ \frac{x^{1/2}}{z^{-1} e^{x} - \eta} \ .
$$
Here we used the fact that $(1/2)! = \sqrt{\pi}/2$ for reasons we'll understand shortly. Let's now calculate the energy $E$, or more conveniently $\beta\varepsilon$, where the *energy density* $\varepsilon \equiv \frac{E}{V}$, using a similar method. Using the same definitions, we have
$$
\begin{align*}
\beta\varepsilon &= \frac{\beta}{V} \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \varepsilon_\mathbf{k} \langle n_\mathbf{k} \rangle \\
&\approx \beta\frac{g}{(2\pi)^3} \int_0^\infty 4\pi k^2 dk \ \frac{\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}}{e^{-\beta\mu} e^{\beta\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}} - \eta} \\
&= \frac{g}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{(2\pi^{1/2})^3}{2\lambda_T^3} \int_0^\infty dx \ \frac{x^{3/2}}{z^{-1} e^{x} - \eta} \\
&= \frac{3}{2} \frac{g}{\lambda_T^3} \frac{1}{(3/2)!} \int_0^\infty dx \ \frac{x^{3/2}}{z^{-1} e^{x} - \eta} \ .

\end{align*}
$$
Finally, let's calculate the pressure, or really $\beta P$ again for simplicity. Recall by extensivity that we can write $\log \mathcal{Z} = \beta P V$. Thus,
$$
\begin{align*}
\beta P &= \frac{1}{V} \log\mathcal{Z} \\
&\approx \frac{-\eta g}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3 \mathbf{k} \  \log \bigg(1 + \eta e^{-\beta \big(\varepsilon_\mathbf{k} - \mu\big)}\bigg) \\
&= \frac{-\eta g}{(2\pi)^3} \int_0^\infty 4\pi k^2 dk \  \log \bigg(1 + \eta z e^{-\frac{\beta\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}}\bigg) \\
&= \frac{-\eta g}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{(2\pi^{1/2})^5}{2\lambda_T^3} \int_0^\infty dx \ x^{1/2} \log \bigg(1 + \eta z e^{-x}\bigg) \\
&= \frac{g}{\lambda_T^3} \frac{1}{(3/2)!} \int_0^\infty dx \ \frac{x^{3/2}}{z^{-1} e^x - \eta} \ .
\end{align*}
$$
In the last line we used integration by parts to move the derivative from $\log \big(1 + \eta z e^{-x}\big)$ to $x^{1/2}$ and made use of the fact that the boundary terms vanish. The reason we did this was to show how all of the above expressions involve an integral that more or less looks alike apart from some parameter. Let's give this class of integrals a name by defining
$$
\boxed{
f_s^\eta (z) \equiv \frac{1}{(s-1)!} \int_0^\infty dx \ \frac{x^{s-1}}{z^{-1} e^x - \eta}
} \ .
$$
We'll study the properties of these functions in the next section. For now just observe that if we make this substitution, we can simplify the above expressions by writing
$$
\boxed{
\begin{align*}
n &= \frac{g}{\lambda_T^3} f_{3/2}^\eta(z) \\
\beta \varepsilon &= \frac{3}{2} \frac{g}{\lambda_T^3} f_{5/2}^\eta(z) \\
\beta P &= \frac{g}{\lambda_T^3} f_{5/2}^\eta(z) \\
\end{align*}
} \ .
$$
We can immediately read off the important relation $\varepsilon = \frac{3}{2} P$, which just says $E = \frac{3}{2} PV$. We've seen this before for the classical ideal gas. Evidently the relationship holds for the quantum ideal gas as well, both for fermions and bosons. However, the relation between $P$ and $n$ is no longer as straightforward as it was in the classical case. To figure that relationship out we'll need to get a series expansion for $f_s^\eta(z)$ so we can express $z$ as a function of $n$ and hence get a virial expansion of $P$ as a function of $n$.

### Special Functions

Given these special functions $f_s^\eta(z)$ seem to occur so frequently in quantum statistics, perhaps we should study their properties a little bit before proceeding to a more detailed study of the quantum ideal gas. These special functions are a well-known class of mathematical functions known as *polylogarithms*. They're a generalization of yet another class of special functions called *zeta functions*. Zeta functions, denoted $\zeta(s)$ are defined by the arithmetic series expression
$$
\zeta(s) \equiv \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = 1 + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots \ .
$$
For real-valued $s$, zeta functions converge whenever $s > 1$ and diverge otherwise.  However, even when these functions do converge we can't generally find $\zeta(s)$ in closed form for most values of $s$. In fact we only have closed-form expressions for *even* integer values of $s$. For example, it's known that $\zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$ and $\zeta(4) = \frac{\pi^4}{90}$. Even $\zeta(3) \approx 1.202$ doesn't have a closed-form expression and has to be found numerically. It's evidently a new irrational number now known as *Apery's constant*.

Polylogarithms, usually denoted $\text{Li}_s(z)$, generalize zeta functions by turning them into a power series in some variable $z$,
$$
\text{Li}_s(z) \equiv \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n^s} = z + \frac{z^2}{2^s} + \frac{z^3}{3^s} + \cdots \ .
$$
Evidently when $z=1$ we just get back the zeta functions, i.e. $\text{Li}_s(1) = \zeta(s)$. Polylogarithms are *strictly speaking* only well-defined in the interval $|z| < 1$. However, the functions can be analytically continued to cover the whole real line except when $z=1$ and $s < 1$, in which case there will generally be an asymptote at $z=1$. Here's a plot of the principle branch of $\text{Li}_s(z)$ for a few values different of $s$. We can see when $s < 1$ the curves asymptote at $z=1$, otherwise they just continue on.

![](./resources/tmp-3208225.png){fig-align=center width=400}

Since there's no constant term in the series it evidently must be the case that $\text{Li}_s(0)=0$. Moreover, when $z$ is small we must have $\text{Li}_s(z) \approx z$, which as we'll soon see turns out to be important to us.

The name "polylogarithm" comes from the fact that the functions satisfy the differentiation ladder relationship
$$
\frac{d}{dz} \text{Li}_s(z) = \frac{\text{Li}_{s-1}(z)}{z} \ ,
$$
which combined with the fact that $\text{Li}_1(z) = -\log (1-z)$ implies that when $s$ is an integer these functions are just successive derivatives of logarithms. This ladder relation gives us an easy way to find other values of $\text{Li}_s(z)$ provided we know the functional form for some $s$, though it only works for finding integer steps of $s$.

Perhaps most importantly for our purposes, polylogarithms can be re-expressed in an integral form that we'll recognize. Observe that by using the expression for a geometric series plus the integral representation of the factorial function that we can rewrite the polylogarithm as
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Li}_s(z) &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n^s} \\
&= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^n}{(s-1)!} \frac{(s-1)!}{n^s}\\
&= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^n}{(s-1)!} \int_0^{\infty} dx \ x^{s-1} e^{-nx} \\
&= \frac{1}{(s-1)!} \int_0^{\infty} dx \ x^{s-1} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \big(z e^{-x}\big)^n \\
&= \frac{1}{(s-1)!} \int_0^{\infty} dx \ \frac{x^{s-1}}{z^{-1} e^x - 1} \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Evidently this is just the expression for $f_s^\eta(z)$ that we saw before when $\eta = 1$! That is, $f_s^{+}(s) = \text{Li}_s(z)$ exactly. What about when $\eta = -1$ though? We can get a similar relationship by just replacing $z$ with $-z$ in the series to get $\text{Li}_s(z)=-\text{Li}_s(-z)$. We can combine the two expressions into one by writing
$$
f_s^\eta(z) = \eta \text{Li}_s(\eta z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\eta^{n+1} z^n}{n^s} = z + \frac{\eta z^2}{2^s} + \frac{z^3}{3^s} + \frac{\eta z^4}{4^s} + \cdots \ .
$$
That is, the functions $f_s^\eta(z)$ we're seeing fall out of quantum statistics are just polylogarithms, with the caveat that when $\eta=-1$ the series is alternating on even powers. In either case, we can see that $f_s^\eta(z) \approx z$ when $z$ is small. Treating $z$ as the fugacity, $z$ will be small at high temperatures, meaning in the high temperature limit our equation of state becomes $\beta P \approx n$. This expression is of course none other the classical ideal gas law $PV = N k_B T$. Evidently the quantum ideal gases reduces to the classical ideal gas in the high temperature limit, as we'd expect, both for fermions as well as bosons. The distinction between the two types of particles washes out in a sense with higher temperatures.

But what about at lower temperatures? First let's define $d \equiv \frac{n \lambda_T^3}{g}$, which we'll call the *degeneracy factor* for reasons we'll see later. If we again want pressure as a function of density we'd need to invert the power series for $d = d(z)$ to find $z = z(d)$. We've seen before how to systematically do this. Starting with the power series for $d = f_{3/2}^\eta (z)$ we have
$$
d = z + \frac{\eta z^2}{2^{3/2}} + \frac{z^3}{3^{3/2}} + O(z^4) \ .
$$
Now suppose $z$ can be expanded in a power series in $d$ as
$$
z = a_1 d + a_2 d^2 + a_3 d^3 + O(d^4)
$$
When $z$ is infinitesimal we see $d \approx z$, which means $a_1 = 1$. To get the higher order coefficients we'll substitute this expression into the formula for $d=d(z)$ and match powers. We have
$$
\begin{align*}
d &= \big(d + a_2 d^2 + a_3 d^3\big) + \frac{\eta}{2^{3/2}} \big(d + a_2 d^2 + a_3 d^3\big)^2 + \frac{1}{3^{3/2}} \big(d + a_2 d^2 + a_3 d^3\big)^3 + O(d^4) \\
&= \big(d + a_2 d^2 + a_3 d^3\big) + \frac{\eta}{2^{3/2}} (d^2 + 2 a_2 d^3) + \frac{1}{3^{3/2}} d^3 + O(d^4) \\
&= d + \bigg(a_2 + \frac{\eta}{2^{3/2}}\bigg) d^2 + \bigg(a_3 + 2 \frac{\eta}{2^{3/2}} a_2 + \frac{1}{3^{3/2}}\bigg) d^3 + O(d^4) \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Setting the higher-order coefficients to zero, we get $a_2 = - \frac{\eta}{2^{3/2}}$ and $a_3 = \frac{1}{4}  -\frac{1}{3^{3/2}}$. Thus, up to $O(d^3)$ we have
$$
z = d - \frac{\eta}{2^{3/2}} d^2 + \bigg(\frac{1}{4}  -\frac{1}{3^{3/2}}\bigg) d^3 + O(d^4) \ .
$$
Plugging this expression back into $\beta P$ to get an expansion in powers of $n$ by substituting $d = \frac{n \lambda_T^3}{g}$, we have
$$
\begin{align*}
\beta P &= \frac{g}{\lambda_T^3} \bigg(z + \frac{\eta}{2^{5/2}} z^2 + \frac{1}{3^{5/2}} z^3 + O(z^4)\bigg) \\
&= \frac{g}{\lambda_T^3} \bigg\{\bigg[d - \frac{\eta}{2^{3/2}} d^2 + \bigg(\frac{1}{4}  -\frac{1}{3^{3/2}}\bigg) d^3\bigg] + \frac{\eta}{2^{5/2}} \bigg[d - \frac{\eta}{2^{3/2}} d^2 + \bigg(\frac{1}{4}  -\frac{1}{3^{3/2}}\bigg) d^3\bigg]^2 \\
&+ \frac{1}{3^{5/2}} \bigg[d - \frac{\eta}{2^{3/2}} d^2 + \bigg(\frac{1}{4}  -\frac{1}{3^{3/2}}\bigg) d^3\bigg]^3 + O(d^4)\bigg\} \\
&= 
\end{align*}
$$
Up to $O(n^3)$ we finally have a virial expansion of the form
$$
\beta P = n - \frac{\eta \lambda_T^3}{g} n^2 + \frac{\lambda_T^6}{g^2} \bigg(\frac{1}{8} - \frac{2}{3^{5/2}}\bigg) n^3 + O(n^4) \ .
$$
Notice how even with no interactions present in the quantum ideal gas we still get a virial expansion. In particular, notice the second virial coefficient $B_2(T) = -\frac{\eta \lambda_T^3}{g}$. For *bosons* $B_2$ is *negative*, meaning the pressure is *reduced* from that of the classical ideal gas. On the other hand, for *fermions* $B_2$ is *positive*, meaning the pressure is *increased* from that of the classical ideal gas. It's *as if* there are interactions present arising from quantum statistics, which we also saw more explicitly in the position representation.

## Degenerate Gases

We've largely gone as far as we can by treating bosons and fermions together. We've shown that in the classical limit of $d \ll 1$ the quantum ideal gas becomes the classical ideal gas, both for fermions and bosons. We've also shown how we can add in quantum corrections to the pressure at lower temperatures via a kind of virial expansion. 

But what about in the other limit, the *low temperature limit* where $d \gg 1$? In this *degenerate* limit expansions in powers of $z$ no longer hold and we need to approach things differently. We'll start by examining the degenerate limit for fermions, the so-called *degenerate fermi gas*. Afterwards we'll separately look at the degenerate limit for bosons, the *degenerate boson gas*.

### Degenerate Fermi Gas

To understand the behavior of fermions at low temperatures we need a different kind of representation for the polylogarithm, namely an *asymptotic series* that's valid when $z$ becomes infinitely large. We'll need to derive an *asymptotic series* for $f_s^{-}(z)$. We'll derive a full expansion later. But for now we'll focus on the extreme low temperature limit where $T \approx 0$, meaning $\log z \gg 1$. Recall that by definition we have
$$
f_s^{-}(z) = \frac{1}{(s-1)!} \int_0^{\infty} dx \ \frac{x^{s-1}}{z^{-1} e^x + 1} \ .
$$
Now, observe that the integrand has the form $x^{s-1} \langle n \rangle$ where $\langle n \rangle = (z^{-1} e^x + 1)^{-1}$ is the expected occupation number. We know that for fermions the occupation number should change abruptly from one to zero especially at low temperatures. If we plot $\langle n \rangle$as a function of $x$ we get something like the figure shown below. As $z$ gets larger the curve of $\langle n \rangle$ approaches more and more of a step function that goes rapidly to zero around $x \approx \log z$.

![](./resources/image-20231224204858169.png){fig-align=center width=400}

This means that to a crude approximation we can treat $\langle n \rangle$ as a step function that jumps from one to zero at $x = \log z$. This means near zero temperature we can approximately write
$$
f_s^{-}(z) = \frac{1}{(s-1)!} \int_0^{\infty} dx \ \frac{x^{s-1}}{z^{-1} e^x + 1} \approx \frac{1}{(s-1)!} \int_0^{\log z} dx \ x^{s-1} = \frac{(\log z)^s}{s!} \ .
$$
Using the identity $\log z = \beta\mu$, we then get
$$
\begin{align*}
N &= \frac{gV}{\lambda_T^3} \frac{(\beta\mu)^{3/2}}{(3/2)!} \ , \\
E &= \frac{3}{2 \beta} \frac{gV}{\lambda_T^3} \frac{(\beta\mu)^{5/2}}{(5/2)!} \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Note the chemical potential $\mu$ here should be thought of as a function of temperature $T$. Near $T=0$ the chemical potential should be some constant value. This value $\varepsilon_F \equiv \mu_0$ is a constant with units of energy. It's called the **Fermi energy**, which in terms of the density $n$ is apparently given by
$$
\varepsilon_F = \frac{2\pi\hbar^2}{m} \bigg(\frac{3\sqrt{\pi}n}{4g}\bigg)^{2/3} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \bigg(\frac{6\pi^2 n}{g}\bigg)^{2/3} \ .
$$
From this equation it makes sense to go ahead and define a **Fermi temperature** $T_F$ using the relation $\varepsilon_F \equiv k_B T_F$. We'll see why later. Notice the right-hand side of the previous formula looks like the energy eigenvalue $\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \mathbf{k}^2$. This means it makes sense to also define a **Fermi momentum** whose wavevector $\mathbf{k}_F$ is given by the relation
$$
\varepsilon_F \equiv \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \mathbf{k}_F^2 \ .
$$
Curiously, we can derive the Fermi energy in a slightly different way without relying on all the machinery we've developed, as is typically done in solid state or quantum physics. The idea is to note that in $k$-space all particles must lie inside the sphere whose radius is $k_F$. If we assume each particle can take on only their spin degrees of freedom $g=2s+1$, this means we'd have
$$
N = \sum_{k \leq k_F} (2s+1) \approx \frac{gV}{(2\pi)^3} \int_0^{k_F} 4\pi k^2 dk = \frac{gVk_F^3}{6\pi^2} \ .
$$
Substituting in $\varepsilon_F = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} k_F^2$ into this formula and solving for $\varepsilon_F$ in terms of $n = \frac{N}{V}$ gives an identical result, with less work.

Anyway, if we now take the ratio $\frac{E}{N}$ to get the energy in terms of particle number like we're used to, we get
$$
E = \frac{3}{5} N \varepsilon_F = \frac{3}{5} N k_B T_F \ .
$$
Interestingly, it seems the energy of a Fermi gas doesn't go to zero at zero temperature. It tends to a positive constant. A Fermi gas *always* has energy due to the exclusion principle preventing the particles from falling into lower energy states. Similarly, a Fermi gas must have non-zero pressure at zero temperature as well since $E = \frac{3}{2} PV$ implies
$$
P V = \frac{2}{5} N \varepsilon_F = \frac{2}{5} N k_B T_F \ .
$$
This defines a kind of pressure $P_F \equiv \frac{2}{5} n \varepsilon_F$ called the **Fermi pressure**. It again arises from the exclusion principle due to the fact that we can't squeeze the fermions arbitrarily close together.

### Sommerfeld Expansion

These expressions tell us what to expect exactly at zero temperature. But what about *near* zero temperature? How do the equations of state interpolate between these values and the expected classical ones? To investigate this we'll need to consider more than just the first term in the asymptotic expansion. We need the full asymptotic series now, which we derive below. 

Let's consider again the integral definition of $f_s^{-}(z)$ and perform integration by parts by moving one of the derivatives from $x^{s-1}$ to $\langle n \rangle = \big(z^{-1} e^x + 1\big)^{-1}$. Then we have
$$
\begin{align*}
f_s^{-}(z) &= \frac{1}{(s-1)!} \int_0^{\infty} dx \ \frac{x^{s-1}}{z^{-1} e^x + 1} \\
&= \frac{1}{s!} \int_0^{\infty} dx \ x^s \frac{d}{dx} \frac{-1}{z^{-1} e^x + 1} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{s!} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx \ x^s \frac{d}{dx} \frac{-1}{z^{-1} e^x + 1} \ .
\end{align*}
$$
The last step requires some justification. Since $\langle n \rangle$ is approximately a step function when $z \gg 1$ its derivative must be approximately a delta function. This means the integrand will be sharply peaked around $\log z$ and so extending the limits of integration to the whole real line is essentially immaterial, though convenient.

We'll now make a change of variable. Let $u = x - \log z$, meaning $x = \log z + u$ and $dx = du$. Substituting, doing a binomial expansion on $x^s = (\log z + u)^s$, and then reversing the integration by parts, we get
$$
\begin{align*}
f_s^{-}(z) &\approx \frac{1}{s!} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} du \ (\log z + u)^s \frac{d}{du} \frac{-1}{e^u + 1} \\
&= \frac{1}{s!} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} du \sum_{\alpha=0}^\infty \binom{s}{\alpha} u^\alpha (\log z)^{s-\alpha} \frac{d}{du} \frac{-1}{e^u + 1} \\
&= \frac{(\log z)^s}{s!} \sum_{\alpha=0}^\infty \frac{s!}{\alpha!(s-\alpha)!} (\log z)^{-\alpha} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} du \ u^\alpha \frac{d}{du} \frac{-1}{e^u + 1} \\
&= \frac{(\log z)^s}{s!} \sum_{\alpha=0}^\infty \frac{s!}{\alpha!(s-\alpha)!} (\log z)^{-\alpha} \alpha \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} du \ \frac{u^{\alpha-1}}{e^u + 1} \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Now, the integrand in the last line, call it $g(u)$, is always either an odd or even function depending on $\alpha$. When $\alpha$ is *odd* the integral must be zero, and when $\alpha$ is *even* the integral must be twice the positive part, both by symmetry. Moreover, the positive part of the integral is just $(2\alpha-1)! f_{2\alpha}^{-}(1)$ since $u$ is a dummy variable and $z=1$. This means we have

$$
\begin{align*}
f_s^{-}(z) &= \frac{(\log z)^s}{s!} \sum_{\alpha=0}^\infty \frac{s!}{(s-\alpha)!} (\log z)^{-\alpha} \frac{1}{(\alpha-1)!} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} du \ \frac{u^{\alpha-1}}{e^u + 1} \\
&= \frac{(\log z)^s}{s!} \sum_{\alpha=0}^\infty \frac{s!}{(s-2\alpha)!} (\log z)^{-2\alpha} \frac{2}{(2\alpha-1)!} \int_0^{\infty} du \ \frac{u^{2\alpha-1}}{e^u + 1} \\
&= \frac{(\log z)^s}{s!} \sum_{\alpha=0}^\infty \frac{s!}{(s-2\alpha)!} (\log z)^{-2\alpha} 2f_{2\alpha}^{-}(1) \\
\end{align*}
$$
Now, notice that $f_{2\alpha}^{-}(1)$ is kind of like a zeta function since
$$
f_s^{-}(1) = -\text{Li}_s (-1) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n^s} = 1 - \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} - \cdots \ .
$$
In fact these functions, called *eta functions* and denoted $\eta(s)$, are related to zeta functions by $\eta(s) = \big(1-2^{1-s}\big) \zeta(s)$. This can be seen by separating the odd and even parts of the series and doing some factoring. Using this relationship along with the fact that zeta function values for even integers $s=2\alpha$ have closed form solutions, we finally have
$$
\begin{align*}
f_s^{-}(z) &= \frac{(\log z)^s}{s!} \sum_{\alpha=0}^\infty \frac{s!}{(s-2\alpha)!} (\log z)^{-2\alpha} 2\big(1-2^{1-2\alpha}\big) \zeta(2\alpha) \\
&= \frac{(\log z)^s}{s!} \bigg[1 + \zeta(2) \frac{s(s-1)}{(\log z)^2} + \frac{7\zeta(4)}{4}\frac{s(s-1)(s-2)(s-3)}{(\log z)^4} + O\big((\log z)^{-6}\big) \bigg] \\
&= \frac{(\log z)^s}{s!} \bigg[1 + \frac{\pi^2}{6} \frac{s(s-1)}{(\log z)^2} + \frac{7\pi^4}{360}\frac{s(s-1)(s-2)(s-3)}{(\log z)^4} + O\big((\log z)^{-6}\big) \bigg] \ .
\end{align*}
$$
This final series is known as the **Sommerfeld expansion**. Notice the leading term in the series is just $f_s^{-}(z) \approx \frac{(\log z)^s}{s!}$, which we already expect. This leads to the Fermi values derived before. The higher order terms in the expansion involve reciprocal powers of $\log z$, which act to give small corrections to the asymptotic expansion at large $z$.

We can now use the Sommerfeld expansion to finally calculate the first few corrections to the equations of state at zero temperature. To do that we need to get the series for $s=\frac{3}{2}$ and $s=\frac{5}{2}$. Working only to the first correction, we have
$$
\begin{align*}
f_{3/2}^{-}(z) &= \frac{(\log z)^{3/2}}{(3/2)!} \bigg[1 + \frac{\pi^2/8}{(\log z)^2} + O\big((\log z)^{-4}\big) \bigg] \ , \\
f_{5/2}^{-}(z) &= \frac{(\log z)^{5/2}}{(5/2)!} \bigg[1 + \frac{5\pi^2/8}{(\log z)^2} + O\big((\log z)^{-4}\big) \bigg] \ .
\end{align*}
$$
Again using the fact that $\log z = \beta\mu$ we can read off the corrections to the equations of state. First, we have
$$
N = \frac{gV}{\lambda_T^3} f_{3/2}^\eta(z) = \frac{gV}{\lambda_T^3} \frac{(\beta\mu)^{3/2}}{(3/2)!} \bigg[1 + \frac{\pi^2}{8} \bigg(\frac{k_B T}{\varepsilon_F}\bigg)^2 + O(T^4) \bigg] \ .
$$
We can use this formula to solve for the chemical potential $\mu$ by rearranging terms to get
$$
\mu = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \bigg(\frac{6\pi^2 N}{gV}\bigg)^{2/3} \bigg[1 + \frac{\pi^2}{8} \bigg(\frac{k_B T}{\varepsilon_F}\bigg)^2 + O(T^4) \bigg]^{-2/3} = \varepsilon_F \bigg[1 - \frac{\pi^2}{12}\bigg(\frac{T}{T_F}\bigg)^2 + O(T^4) \bigg] \ .
$$
This means the chemical potential is evidently a downward-sloping parabola at low temperatures with a vertex at the Fermi energy $\varepsilon_F$. We also expect classically that $\mu \sim -T \log T$ at high temperatures, so the two curves should smoothly interpolate somehow, as shown in the figure below. The transition regime occurs somewhere around the Fermi temperature $T_F$.

FIGURE

Next up, we can find the pressure by using the above expansion for $\mu$ to get
$$
\begin{align*}
P &= \frac{g}{\beta\lambda_T^3} f_{5/2}^\eta(z) \\
&= \frac{g}{\beta\lambda_T^3} \frac{(\beta\mu)^{5/2}}{(5/2)!} \bigg[1 + \frac{5\pi^2}{8} \bigg(\frac{k_B T}{\varepsilon_F}\bigg)^2 + O(T^4) \bigg] \\
&= \frac{g}{\beta\lambda_T^3} \frac{(\beta\varepsilon_F)^{5/2}}{(5/2)!} \bigg[1 - \frac{\pi^2}{12}\bigg(\frac{T}{T_F}\bigg)^2 + O(T^4) \bigg]^{5/2} \bigg[1 + \frac{5\pi^2}{8} \bigg(\frac{T}{T_F}\bigg)^2 + O(T^4) \bigg] \\
&= P_F \bigg[1 + \frac{5\pi^2}{12}\bigg(\frac{T}{T_F}\bigg)^2 + O(T^4) \bigg] \ .

\end{align*}
$$
Evidently the correction to the pressure is also quadratic, but this time the parabola is *upward sloping*, causing pressure to increase with temperature. In the classical limit of course we expect pressure to become linear $P \sim T$, with a turning point occurring again around the Fermi temperature $T_F$. This is shown in the figure below.

FIGURE

With the pressure in hand we can now proceed to calculate the average internal energy using the formula $E = \frac{3}{2} PV$. We get
$$
E = \frac{3}{5} N k_B T_F \bigg[1 + \frac{5\pi^2}{12}\bigg(\frac{T}{T_F}\bigg)^2 + O(T^4) \bigg] \ .
$$
Clearly the energy will also be an upward-sloping parabola at low temperatures and have $E \sim T$ at high temperatures. Having energy as a function of temperature we can proceed to calculate the heat capacity for the Fermi gas at low temperatures. Differentiating with respect to $T$ we get
$$
C = \frac{\partial E}{\partial T} = \frac{\pi^2}{2} N k_B \bigg(\frac{T}{T_F}\bigg) + O(T^3) \ .
$$
Importantly, notice that at low temperatures the heat capacity of a Fermi gas is *linear* with a cubic correction. As $T$ approaches the Fermi temperature $T_F$ the heat capacity turns over and starts to behave classically, as shown in the figure below.

FIGURE

We've actually seen this behavior before when we studied the heat capacity of solids. Recall that for a typical solid $C \sim T^3$ at low temperatures. However, we mentioned that for *metals* the heat capacity actually goes more like $C \sim \alpha T + \beta T^3$ without explaining why this was the case. Now we can. Metals differentiate themselves from other solids in that electrons can move around. They're not bound to atoms as would typically be the case for a solid. We can think of these freely flowing electrons as a Fermi gas, which gives the heat capacity of metals a linear contribution. They also contribute an added cubic contribution to the usual solid heat capacity. Note for typical metals like iron the Fermi temperature tends to be around $T_F \sim 1000 \ ^\circ \text{K}$, meaning these affects can often be observed in metals even at room temperature.
